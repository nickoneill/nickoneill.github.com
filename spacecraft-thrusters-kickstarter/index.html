<p>Wanna back something novel on Kickstarter? <a href="http://www.hyperv.com/">HyperV</a> is attempting to raise funds to develop <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2027072188/plasma-jet-electric-thrusters-for-spacecraft">plasma jet thrusters</a> that could be used in spacecraft outside of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly citizen science (which I&rsquo;d like to see on Kickstarter some day) but it&rsquo;s a great start if you want to be involved with funding an awesome science and technology project and get interesting updates along the way.</p>

<p>Ignore their standard science company website and the slightly awkward funding video and back their awesome project today!</p>

<p>Update: They were successful! They&rsquo;ve done a really great job of keeping backers up-to-date on the project so far, I think this is a great model for science on Kickstarter.</p>
