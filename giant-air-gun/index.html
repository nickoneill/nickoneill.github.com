<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what this <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/2012/04/06/vera-super-spud-gun/">giant air gun</a> is used for (&ldquo;research&rdquo;, clearly) but the people who built it made an excellent video showing off its capabilities with <em>slow motion</em>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a good reason to launch things at high speed with &ldquo;low&rdquo; acceleration (&lt; 600g) but the author of the video is clearly playing it casual. From the description:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the world of ordnance system development the need for system and subsystem testing under dynamic conditions is obvious.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Obviously</em>.</p>
