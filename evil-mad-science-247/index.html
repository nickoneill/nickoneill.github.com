<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of the Evil Mad Scientists since I first saw Egg Bot back at the first Maker Faire. Windell and Lenore essentially invented the type of business they run now (along with Adafruit, Sparkfun and others) and the two of them are finally doing <a href="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/moreevilmad">Evil Mad Science full time</a>.</p>

<p>I love it when smart people can grow a totally different business into something that can both support the community and the people behind it. Congrats to them!</p>
