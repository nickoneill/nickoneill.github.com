<p>Possibly my favorite part of this <a href="http://kottke.org/12/04/slow-motion-stupidity">montage of dumb things filmed with a high speed camera</a> is the physics.</p>

<p>At 2500fps it gets really obvious that gravity and air resistance play a major role in slowing down fast moving things. Even small pieces of watermelon that are ejected by fireworks get noticeably slower right after the explosion. I won&rsquo;t bother with the kinematics, I&rsquo;m sure you get all the video analysis you need from <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/dotphysics/">Dot Physics</a>.</p>

<p>I noticed two really fast things in this video, one of which is obvious and the other not so much. Can you guess what they are?</p>
