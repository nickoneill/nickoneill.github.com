<p>Need some help getting ready for Sunday&rsquo;s MSL landing on Mars? <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/02/mars-science-laboratory-rover.html">BoingBoing has details</a> of all the online NASA livestream events where you can watch the landing (more or less) live.</p>

<p>Landing should occur at 10:31pm Pacific time on Sunday night. It&rsquo;s great timing for the west coast, I might make a little Google hangout for anyone else watching on Sunday.</p>
