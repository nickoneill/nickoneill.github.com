*Yes, there's a real [Apple University](), it's not related*

It's recruiting season (the only season in San Francisco) and I recently got an email from a recruiter at Apple. I'm pretty happy working for myself at the moment so I declined but it was fascinating to think about in the context of my past goals and the future of startup recruiting.

It had always been a dream of mine to work at Apple since before I moved to San Francisco (almost nine years ago!) and I wondered when that changed. I would have jumped at the chance during my last year at Six Apart and even the first few years I was working for myself.

Professionally, if I had been recruited and hired during those periods I expect that I would have been a good addition to whatever team I joined, especially if given the same opportunity to learn iOS development in the intervening years as I have on my own.

Apple, like many big tech companies, is in a tough situation. Too many talented engineers at the top of their game get lured away by other hard problems, big money or the ideal of starting a company. There's probably something to be said about keeping them intellectually challenged so they want to stay at Apple but that's not necessarily what I'm interested in. Employees will always leave to do other things - who will replace them as the next generation of great engineers at a company that values great engineering?
