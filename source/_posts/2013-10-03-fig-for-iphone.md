Something new, but not really.

Back in the early summer I released an app side project for making gifs on your iPhone: [Fig](http://makefi.gs). 

I think I worked on this project during a blog hiatus which is a bit weird for me; this blog probably contains mostly project posts by weight.

Once I switched over to octopress and everything was humming again I just forgot to post about it. Even though most (sometimes all) of what is on a blog is old or out of date, I don't think about writing about anything that isn't HERE and NOW.
