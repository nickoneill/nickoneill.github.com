Quadcopter videos are awesome!

The best part about this is that it&apos;s really not super expensive. Quadcopter kits are easily under $500 (less if you already have some of the electronics) and small HD cameras like the Go Pro are ~$300, so you can shoot awesome aerial footage for significantly less than $1000. There are plenty of more expensive hobbies.
