I’m starting this course in [Quantum Computation via edx.org](https://www.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS191x/2013_Spring/about) and finding, as I always do, that the mathematics involved is impenetrable. I’m a pretty clever guy so I always wonder why I have such issues with math courses. Learning a new language isn’t frustrating as much as a fun challenge as you discover and implement various rules even though you have no idea what the vocabulary is. I regularly work on programming tasks that are challenging, including some that could be considered applied mathematics. None of this is so difficult as trying to learn something new that is a step or two beyond my current comfort level in mathematics.

It’s not that the math is unintuitive once you understand what’s going on – quite the opposite, actually – but mathematics insists on wrapping every definition in a series of terms that also need definition. Mathematicians will dismiss this as the need to have precision when defining terms which seems perfectly reasonable if you’re two equally learned mathematicians talking to one another. It’s a pretty poor approach if you’re attempting to teach students though, particularly in a class such as this which has a varied base of experience. I could go on for longer about the implications of this approach on mathematics education in the United States in regards to the social stigma it has but I’m not really in the mood.

What's baffling is that so many courses and books choose to apply only the most rigorous and opaque treatment to these topics. A simple definition of
