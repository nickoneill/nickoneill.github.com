<p>There&rsquo;s something about this <a href="http://gofreerange.com/hello-printer">tiny, open source printer</a> that makes me think about non-digital communication in a positive way, which is a somewhat rare occurrence. Something about the way it&rsquo;s designed and how nicely the print quality isâ€¦ and the simplicity of it all.</p>

<p>Also, when I said &ldquo;open source&rdquo; I really meant it. <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer/wiki/Making-your-own-printer">You build the printer</a>.</p>
