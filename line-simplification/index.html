<p><a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/simplify/">This post</a> about line simplification may seem esoteric but it&rsquo;s work like this, displayed and understood simply, that pushes technology forward. It&rsquo;s not new research but it&rsquo;s applied in a way that fits exactly the use case that a niche needs.</p>

<p>All it takes is an idea of how to do something better, or faster or more clearly. Suddenly there are three libraries in every language that do it and everyone gets a better experience.</p>

<p>Also, I love the idea of blogpost note margins so much that I may steal it.</p>
