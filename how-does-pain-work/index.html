<p>This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mcuIc5O-DE&amp;feature=player_embedded">animated TED talk</a> is actually about how pain <em>relievers</em> work but it explains the basis of pain as well, including some curious details that I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>George Zaidan (creator of the lesson, not the animator) finds a way to explain some fairly complicated biology without resorting to useless over simplications (it works by &ldquo;blocking pain&rdquo;!). I&rsquo;ll have to flip through more educational videos on <a href="http://ed.ted.com/">TED-ed</a>.</p>
