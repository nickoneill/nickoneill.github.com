	<h2 class="title">A Personal Virtual Space</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>High above the surrounding forrest, a <a href="http://imgur.com/a/1DhuT">small wooden house sits on a pillar of stone</a><sup>1</sup>. It has a single inhabitant who visits daily to improve on the structure and explore the world, often bringing back rare materials from mines underground or far away lands. For as far as we can compute, this land is devoid of any other humans or human-built structures. Sometimes a few friends visit, popping in and out of existence nearby and making their way to the sole pillar of sentience in a vast blockscape of computer generated valleys and oceans.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not an unlikely paragraph in an average internet-era scifi novel. The idea of visiting the virtual world of a friend seems like old news when you take the concept of 3D first-person exploration, the ability to connect with a friend from anywhere on the planet via the internet and the basic need for users to have a place to call home. Despite this, Personal Virtual Spaces have remained elusive to the average internet user &ndash; at least in any form that puts users first.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say there haven&rsquo;t been attempts. In fact, most massively multiplayer games have some sense of &ldquo;home&rdquo; for the user but these features are bolted on and mostly used as extra storage for RPG-style games. Like so many things, it seems that the harder a game tries to implement a personal space the harder they fail at actually doing so.</p>

<p>Minecraft, on the other hand, is the first real success at having your own world that you can share with friends. And it succeeds at the concept because it tries the <em>least</em>. The game simply gives users the tools to connect and persist and the rest is so open ended that it manages to achieve the goals of anyone who cares to be there. As long as you like adventure or creativity, you can like Minecraft.</p>

<p>I would be mistaken to not mention <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/markpasc/p/treehouses-online-community-for-internet">Mark&rsquo;s Treehouses presentation</a>. I think Mark has some incredibly useful ideas for what could make an intentionally successful PVS product (Minecraft being unintentional, as far as I know), combining knowledge of what Minecraft, Second Life, MUDS and most notably Animal Crossing do correctly and incorrectly. Kids with access to the internet grow up with these limited vitual spaces and it only serves to prime a new generation for more of those types of social interactions over the internet. I think there is a clearly growing segment of internet users who want and would use a well designed PVS on a regular basis.</p>

<p>I have little doubt that there will be more products trying out this space in the near future but there are still lots of questions about how this will materialize. Glitch has seen some success with their web-based Flash 2D world but standards for WebGL (and most recently <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2012/02/gpu-accelerating-2d-canvas-and-enabling.html">hardware-accelerated 2D canvas</a>) are making native 3D games in the browser a very real possibility. And there&rsquo;s always room for more social creativity on the web.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Not mine but pretty cool, right?</p>
