<p>I don&rsquo;t often recommend reading company handbooks but the <a href="http://cdn.flamehaus.com/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf">Valve company handbook</a> is definitely an exception.</p>

<p>It feels like a bunch of smart nerds got together and ignored all the management advice they were given from every other boilerplate company. Then they made a bunch of awesome games and didn&rsquo;t compromise on their values. Now they&rsquo;re rich smart nerds.</p>
