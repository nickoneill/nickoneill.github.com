			Headless Mac Mini With Ubuntu</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&rsquo;s time for another episode (<a href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/ice-cream-sandwich-preview-on-galaxy-tab-101-google-io-edition.html">yet again</a>) of <em>A Technical Guide to a Niche Topic</em>! This episode is sponsored by my insistence that personal research not be lost to the void.</p>

<p>Last weekend I spent an inordinate amount of time getting Ubuntu running without a monitor on a mac mini so I figure I&rsquo;d write up my findings. FYI, this is a 2009 Core Duo Mac Mini. It&rsquo;s not the newer unibody design though I expect many of the details still apply.</p>

<p>The hardest part of the whole damn thing is getting the mini to boot into Ubuntu at all since all new Macs boot with EFI and support for anything other than BIOS is rare for Linux. Luckily Boot Camp does the hard work for us since it&rsquo;s designed to run anything on that partition in a compatibility BIOS mode.</p>

<p>A fresh install of OS X would be great, but an existing install is fine as long as your disk isn&rsquo;t too full. To maintain our Boot Camp compatibility mode we&rsquo;re going to keep a small OS X partition around forever. We&rsquo;ll can get potential Apple firmware updates this way too.</p>

<p>We start in our fresh (or not) OS X machine. Download and install rEFIt, a tool that lets you choose your boot disk when you start up. <strong>You will not see the rEFIt menu the first time you reboot</strong>. It takes two reboots, don&rsquo;t ask me why &ndash; but don&rsquo;t reboot yet.</p>

<p>Open up the Boot Camp utility and set the OS X partition to something small (~10gb) and set the rest as the Boot Camp partition.</p>

<p>Insert your Ubuntu installation cd (yes, physical media) and reboot. Twice. The second time your rEFIt menu should show up and a smug penguin should be holding a CD. Choose that option.</p>

<p>Go through the Ubuntu installation as normal until you get to the disk setup. Choose to manually partition, then format your big empty Boot Camp partition as ext3 and <strong>don&rsquo;t create any more partitions</strong>. Ubuntu will probably hate on this setup as you&rsquo;re writing it to disk, but it will let you do it. Go through the rest of the ubuntu install.</p>

<p>You may be able to add a swap partition later but it&rsquo;s not required to boot and run Ubuntu. I&rsquo;m running mysql, php-fpm, nginx, etc. and I&rsquo;m only at 20% RAM usage (of 2gb).</p>

<p>The machine will restart after installation and rEFIt should show smug penguin again but as a disk this time. Boot it! Everything should come up OK… assuming you have a monitor plugged in.</p>

<p>This is probably a good time to change the rEFIt config to tell it to boot Linux first, particularly later when you won&rsquo;t have a monitor. You&rsquo;ve got to be in OS X to do it, just edit the config in <code>/etc/EFI/refit/</code>.</p>

<p>I wanted this mini to live somewhere hidden away without a monitor so having a monitor constantly plugged in was not something I was interested in. And, of course, without a monitor plugged in the system was never getting to Ubuntu.</p>

<p>After restarting a number of times with screens plugged in or not, I determined that grub was halting the boot for whatever reason. To the googs!</p>

<p>Failure again. I set <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="nomodeset"</code> and a few other grub options, updated grub and rebooted a few times before being unable to fix the issue. I had to go to plan B.</p>

<p>When searching for headless Ubuntu boot issues, I came across an interesting solution that people running folding@home devised. According to them, most systems don&rsquo;t power a second GPU (or a first for that matter) if a monitor isn&rsquo;t plugged in. They wanted to run the folding stuff on an alternate GPU so they had to come up with a method for powering that GPU without actually having a second monitor.</p>

<p>The solution is stupidly simple. VGA connections can &ldquo;simulate&rdquo; a monitor by having resistance across 3 sets of pins. This can be done by literally inserting resistors into a VGA connector, as shown below. It&rsquo;s the DVI-to-VGA connector that shipped with the mini.</p>

<p><span class="blogimage">
<img src="http://blog.nickoneill.name/images/dvivgaadapter.png" alt="DVI to VGA adapter with resistors" />
</span></p>

<p>I searched around for exact specifications and most people say 75 or 68ohm resistors (purple-green-black or blue-gray-black). I only had a few 68ohm resistors on hand so I used those. Apparently anything from 50-150ohm will work (not tested, explosions lol!).</p>

<p>Now grub loves me and restarts jump right into Ubuntu. I tucked the mac mini away and it has been happily chugging away since. Thanks, internet!</p>

			Trailer: Total Recall</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ah, more dystopian future movies. Not quite a remake of 1990&apos;s <em>Total Recall</em> and possibly more closely based on Dick&apos;s <em>We Can Remember It for You Wholesale</em>.</p>

<p>There are just too many awesome ways to go with the memory implantation theme, this particular story deals with being able to completely wipe and implant memories, of course. Believe it or not, I&apos;m not sick of the what-is-real-and-what-is-not theme that&apos;s been ridden so hard for the last ten years. Is there some unspoken rule where movies dealing with reality must be good? Keep &apos;em coming.</p>

<p>The second theme that is noticeable (and enjoyable) is how Quaid (played by Colin Farrell) is subconsciously alerted to his condition by strange and violent dreams. Mother nature is able to subvert even the most complex human technology. I wonder if this theme will play out in the end of the film or if they&apos;ll stick with the alien artifact from the first film.</p>

			Invisible Robota</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>BoingBoing links to a video that accompanies a <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/robots-ate-my-job">Marketplace special</a> on robots taking over Human jobs. It&apos;s a really well done video, with lots of examples that you don&apos;t normally think of as robots but fit the general idea well.</p>

<p>More interestingly is their subtle hint towards the origin of the term robot, from &quot;robota&quot;, a Czech term meaning &quot;serf labor&quot;. This got me thinking about who will build the first robot that will actively reject being called such a name since it reinforces their role as non-citizen labor.</p>

<p>Naturally, robots will agree on a more acceptable name amongst themselves. This will probably not be term &quot;android&quot; since it denotes a robot that disguises itself as a human and robot culture should not have to conform to human cultural norms when robot culture by itself is perfectly valid.</p>

<p>Later robot generations will probably reappropriate the term once robots are sufficiently first-class citizens and enough humans have robotic implants that the connotation no longer makes sense.</p>

			Does the Metro UI Have Room for Smacktalk?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Microsoft is hard at work pushing their new Metro UI in the months leading up to the Windows 8 release sometime in 2012. I don&rsquo;t pay too much attention to most of it but they recently posted a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh868262.aspx">case study for UI differences between a standard iOS interface and Metro</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fairly dismissive of iOS concepts despite usually telling half the story, but it&rsquo;s an interesting study in mobile UI design nonetheless. The justification that the Microsoft team make for their style is fascinating to see through the lens of an iOS interface developer.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll preface this briefly by saying that I&rsquo;m assuming a bit about the Metro UI. I&rsquo;ve looked through a number of examples for how Microsoft expects users to behave in Metro but I haven&rsquo;t installed the Windows 8 preview myself.</p>

<p>I wrote a bit earlier this month about <a href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/on-hidden-touch-gestures.html">my issues with the interface for Clear</a> and this ties in well. Overall, Metro wants developers to focus on content over chrome. The decision isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad one in theory but it does provide some interesting tradeoffs if you miss the mark on assumptions about existing user knowledge.</p>

<p>The case study mentions &ldquo;direct manipulation&rdquo; a number of times, which is essentially gesture-based interaction. Pinching to move from a single-year view to the hierarchically higher level like a list of all years, swiping down from an item to reveal an &ldquo;app bar&rdquo; with contextual commands, swiping from the sides for a standard &ldquo;charms&rdquo; view… the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>Microsoft isn&rsquo;t alone in their apparent love of gestures though,
Apple loves to implement hidden gestures in their apps as well.</p>

<p>And for good reason: gesture interactions are great eye candy. Users think they&rsquo;ll look like Tom Cruise in Minority Report sans the headgear. They&rsquo;re fantastic commercial material because they feel like the future is <em>here</em>.</p>

<p>The difference is that Apple (usually) uses hidden gestures as a secondary method for taking actions that are available via multiple taps. Non-obvious gestures are a power user feature of sorts.</p>

<p>The problem with Metro is that it hides critical functions under this gesture layer. Users can get into situations in Metro apps where the action they know they want to take is nowhere to be found or worse; they unknowingly activate some gesture and it takes them away from what they were doing with no indication of how that action was invoked. This is not a good user experience.</p>

<p>There is no clear solution to this at the moment. This may all sound familiar if you read through my post on Clear but I&rsquo;m not sure if users have trouble with hidden gestures because they&rsquo;re so new or because our eyeballs require interface elements that can&rsquo;t simply be swept under the bezel without indicating some hidden function. I&rsquo;m not exactly advocating for subtle universal indicators for hidden gestures yet, though it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m thinking about.</p>

<p>Of course, some users will know exactly how to navigate Metro apps because they&rsquo;ve watched the videos or know what types of gestures to try on the interface. This is a valid chunk of users who will love Metro &ndash; but is that the same chunk of users that Metro is aimed at? And even if that is some double-digit percentage of users, what about the rest of them?</p>

<p>I expect that Metro wants to be in place where the iPad has found so much success: the living room. But sometimes good design (or technical complexity) in software manages to outshine the notion that the technology just has to work for its intended audience. I&rsquo;ve seen this happen at a number of startups and I doubt Microsoft is immune.</p>

<p>But Metro can probably survive an initial unfamiliarity period if users are constantly beaten (in a good way) into understanding that some of the interface is hidden for cleanliness. This kind of interface can be learned with training and interface training is just reinforcing the concepts with lots and lots of apps that feel the same.</p>

<p>This is why the iOS tab bar and navigation bar that this very document derides have become natural for living room users everywhere. They&rsquo;re easy and cheap to create and they don&rsquo;t look terrible. Even my mother is familiar with them.</p>

<p>So the question becomes one of developer support. How well has Microsoft supported the development of Metro UI in 3rd party apps? For sure they&rsquo;ll launch with a few high-visibility non-Microsoft apps but how is the SDK for everyone else?</p>

<p>And critically, is Microsoft willing to reject apps from their platform if they don&rsquo;t conform to the Metro standards early on?</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I don&rsquo;t think this is a Microsoft vs. Apple conversation. The issue is about how much thought goes into the default look for a platform and how the goals match the implementation. At this point Apple has proven their model with hundreds of Millions of devices and Microsoft has a consumer preview. And who is talking all the smack?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Hey, some people talked about this last week on the internets too, both for <a href="http://reverttosaved.com/2012/03/14/mystery-meat-ui-design-in-windows-8-ios-and-os-x-could-point-to-a-confusing-computing-future/">all the new OSes</a> and specifically for the <a href="http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2012/03/14/mystery_meat_iphoto/">new iPhoto for iOS</a>, via <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/walt/status/183048316563619841">@walt</a>.</p>

			Warehouse Robots for Amazon</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Amazon purchased a company called Kiva (not the microloans place) yesterday that makes warehouse robotics systems that look something like a southeast asian intersection on a good day.</p>

<p>It&apos;s pretty impressive to watch them do their thing without knocking their large stacks of goods over or bumping into eachother, but what is really interesting for me is how precise they are as noted by their tracks on the floor. They all keep to a very precise section of floor which I expect they figure out based on rotary encoding. I&apos;m not sure though, it doesn&apos;t look like a smaller warehouse positioning system since they&apos;re individually fitted with what looks like distance sensors. I&apos;d be interested to know more details about how they work!</p>
