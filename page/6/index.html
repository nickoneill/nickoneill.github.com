			Questions No One Knows the Answers To</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Here&apos;s a video of Chris Anderson&apos;s (yes, the WIRED editor) TED Ed talk on questions that no one knows the answer to. The talk consistently touches on curiosity which is conveniently one of my favorite topics.</p>

<p>Even though it deals primarily with unanswered physics questions, I post it here instead of <a href="http://finestructure.com/">Fine Structure</a> because it&apos;s a basic view of unanswered questions. Scientists have a ton of competing opinions about the details on these unanswered questions &ndash; it&apos;s not like no one is trying to answer them &ndash; and it&apos;s more useful to know that the questions exist in the first place.</p>

			What Do All the Controls in an Airplane Cockpit Do?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A completely amazing answer about every single control in the cockpit of a 737. For all my dislike of Quora and its insular tech-centric postings, posts like this really make up for it.</p>

<p>The answerer (&quot;Tim Morgan&quot;) covers the controls through some well-placed screenshots from a detailed flight simulator. It explains both the incredible sophistication of these planes and the mind-numbing detail pilots must know these systems by. For example:</p>

<p>&gt; Below the IRS panel are some warning lights showing when an IRU has failed, or is on battery backup power, and a pair of knobs that set the left and right IRU mode.  IRUs have to spin up and align before they can be used for navigation, a process that takes 10 minutes.  So the IRU must first be put into ALIGN mode for 10 minutes or so before it can be moved into NAV mode.  If the pilot is in a hurry, he can put the IRU into the emergency ATT (attitude-only) mode, but he will get no position information and only attitude information.</p>

		<a href="/clear/">
		
			On Hidden Touch Gestures</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I downloaded Clear the other day to see what all the fuss is about and I&rsquo;ve run into a slight moral-UX dilemma.</p>

<p>Everything about the first startup of Clear is a tutorial. The default list is all items to help you learn what gestures to do when acting out the essential functions of the app. Add a new task by pulling down, navigate back to the list of lists by pulling down more, swipe left to delete, etc.</p>

<p>Clear hides all these actions behind the list UI in an obsessive way. The concept is what makes Clear such an interesting app in the first place; a list app without all the UI overhead of list navigation elements. But what it gains in cleanliness, it lacks in immediate usability.</p>

<p>As an iOS developer, I try to find ways to make apps intuitive to people without having to use a tutorial. In general, this means avoiding the less obvious touch gestures and swiping a list and dragging items are essentially the only two items in my gesture toolbox. My users should be able to tell me what they can do in a screen easily, with minimal experimentation.</p>

<p>So back to my dilemma: I enjoy using Clear myself and I wish I could add touch gestures into any app I build because they are quite useful for getting rid of extra navigation elements. But I can&rsquo;t, not yet at least.</p>

<p>While watching user testing it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that the majority of people don&rsquo;t automatically understand most touch gestures. Even if you teach them how to navigate by swiping back and forth, it&rsquo;s not easily memorable and it surely doesn&rsquo;t remind users what to do when they&rsquo;re faced with the problem down the road.</p>

<p>Apple has approached this problem in their apps using both methods. There is always a longer flow that takes you through an edit or delete button where the interactions are almost tap-exclusive and, in apps that have extra polish, you can generally swipe or three-finger-something to bypass those extra steps if you know how.</p>

<p>This seems to be the most reasoned approach. Let power users have their quick methods while retaining easy discoverability for novice users.</p>

<p>But is this a long term solution or just a bridge to a world where everyone knows how to swipe to delete?</p>

<p>Clear would play an important role to force users towards a better understanding of possible touch gestures in the latter case, while in the former they simply target power users exclusively.</p>

<p>While I like the idea of this being some middleground before we&rsquo;re all touch gesture-aware, I don&rsquo;t see that as a realistic vision.</p>

<p>What makes products like the iPad special is that anyone can pick them up and roughly know how to operate a well-built app. We&rsquo;ve seen this again and again with babies (and cats) and anyone else who has never used an iPad. It&rsquo;s just natural to use those few core gestures. Removing functionality unless you know secret swipe zones is going against this principle.</p>

<p>If gestures are going to be the only way to navigate, we have to at least make them discoverable &ndash; and not by tutorial. Something must remind us that an action can be taken here.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think icons fill this role very well as one has to learn what the icons represent. And whatever solution is correct will not be based on a purely Apple aesthetic, it has to work across any touch device.</p>

<p>Are there any apps that do a particularly good job at both using different touch gestures and informing users about them?</p>

			The Personal Analytics of Stephen Wolfram</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The kind of data that Stephen Wolfram collects about himself is absolutely mind-boggling. Here he writes a post about data he&apos;s collected, most of it dating back to the early 90s.</p>

<p>I wonder what kind of time he spends getting the systems in place to log, for example, every keystroke he&apos;s ever typed. I like to look back on data and note interesting events and patterns that mean something but I wouldn&apos;t spend any measure of time to set something up for a few extra data points down the road. His blog post doesn&apos;t come any closer to explaining his reasoning for logging everything or what he gets out of it, but I assume it&apos;s something that he enjoys given the amount of effort put in.</p>

<p>&gt; I only remember feeling like I had just had an excellent cup of coffee, but without the caffeine jitters. I felt clear-headed and like myself, just sharper. Calmer. Without fear and without doubt. From there on, I just spent the time waiting for a problem to appear so that I could solve it.</p>

<p>I don&apos;t know a single geek who hasn&apos;t wanted this. Geek life is all about learning new things constantly and developing the talents to tune out all the noise is a part of the process. I would pay handsomely to be able to push a button to get into the zone on an otherwise noisy day.</p>
