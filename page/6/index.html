		<p>Will Wright is back on board the Sim train to Simland.</p>

<p>I pumped a number of hours into Sim City 2000 as a kid (what a big improvement on the original!) but 3000, 4 and the whole Sims franchise were lost on me. I don&apos;t think I missed anything. Anyone disagree?</p>

		<p>The author of <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328501.600-zap-your-brain-into-the-zone-fast-track-to-pure-focus.html">this new scientist article</a> on using transcranial direct current stimulation to boost focus when learning decided to write a bit more on her experiences when testing the equipment:</p>

<p>&gt; I only remember feeling like I had just had an excellent cup of coffee, but without the caffeine jitters. I felt clear-headed and like myself, just sharper. Calmer. Without fear and without doubt. From there on, I just spent the time waiting for a problem to appear so that I could solve it.</p>

<p>I don&apos;t know a single geek who hasn&apos;t wanted this. Geek life is all about learning new things constantly and developing the talents to tune out all the noise is a part of the process. I would pay handsomely to be able to push a button to get into the zone on an otherwise noisy day.</p>

		<p>There was a lot of talk when TBBT first started playing about the accuracy of the science on the show, whiteboards included. Now you can read an interview with the Science Advisor to the show, David Saltzberg.</p>

<p>It&apos;s interesting both for how current physics developments make it onto the show
and for the general behind-the-scenes look at a sitcom in contrast to how it feels on TV.</p>

		<p>Quadcopter videos are awesome!</p>

<p>The best part about this is that it&apos;s really not super expensive. Quadcopter kits are easily under $500 (less if you already have some of the electronics) and small HD cameras like the Go Pro are ~$300, so you can shoot awesome aerial footage for significantly less than $1000. There are plenty of more expensive hobbies.</p>

		<p>Someone at Apple understands that developers drive a platform. Of course, it&apos;s not exceedingly easy to get started developing for the iPhone though it does become apparent that there&apos;s a ton of code from which to draw inspiration and answers once you have a basic grasp of the language and SDK components.</p>

<p>Enter the Apple&apos;s new basic development tutorial. It&apos;ll take you through all the necessary steps for making an application, linking to some more thorough documents that you can tackle one at a time. Great for the aspiring developer.</p>

		<p>Jesse Thorn (I think I&apos;ve mentioned <a href="http://putthison.com/">Put This On</a> before but he can adequately be described as a public radio nerd regardless of if you&apos;ve heard him before) write about <em>things</em> &ndash; methods, outlooks, etc &ndash; that you should do to Make Your Thing. They&apos;re all great notes about specific people who are successful at doing what they care about.</p>

<p>Being Jesse Thorn must be really fascinating. He&apos;s one of these people that is involved random projects from all over. Every time I find a new interesting internet show or podcast there&apos;s a good 50/50 chance that Jesse has had a hand in it. He&apos;s also had a radio show since he was 19 &ndash; the same one, albeit with a slightly different name or content &ndash; and that takes some enviable dedication to have done something for eleven years straight. I wonder what kind of inspiration he had growing up to develop such awesome habits.</p>

		<p>1000 frames per second of an owl about to snatch something after swooping in. I love watching all the intricate movements and the resulting effects on the owl&apos;s position. Watch his head too, it stays very consistent despite all the movement going on around it.</p>

<p>Why can&apos;t we have mechanical objects with such complexity and grace?</p>

			Why Do Some People Learn Faster?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>An oldie but goodie about Failure-Learning loops.</p>

<p>The critical part of this article (and why it feels more concrete than other social science based discussions on learning) is the identification of error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) activity in the brain. Researchers can actually tell if you&apos;re making mistakes and simply giving up or making an effort to learn from your mistake.</p>

<p>My favorite part from the article:
&gt; After the children finished the test, the researchers told the students their score, and provided them with a single line of praise. Half of the kids were praised for their intelligence. “You must be smart at this,” the researcher said. The other students were praised for their effort: “You must have worked really hard.”</p>

<p>After this, the kids were offered a second test with the choice of harder or easier questions:
&gt; When kids were praised for their effort, nearly 90 percent chose the harder set of puzzles. However, when kids were praised for their intelligence, most of them went for the easier test.</p>

<p>So not only can we tell if someone isn&apos;t making mistakes positively, we can influence their learning so that they make better choices and learn from their mistakes in the future!</p>

<p>It fits nicely with my own personal theory: there are no <em>smart</em> people or <em>dumb</em> people, there are people who choose to do smart things and people who choose to do dumb things.</p>
