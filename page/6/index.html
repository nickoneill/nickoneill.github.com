			On Hidden Touch Gestures</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I downloaded Clear the other day to see what all the fuss is about and I&rsquo;ve run into a slight moral-UX dilemma.</p>

<p>Everything about the first startup of Clear is a tutorial. The default list is all items to help you learn what gestures to do when acting out the essential functions of the app. Add a new task by pulling down, navigate back to the list of lists by pulling down more, swipe left to delete, etc.</p>

<p>Clear hides all these actions behind the list UI in an obsessive way. The concept is what makes Clear such an interesting app in the first place; a list app without all the UI overhead of list navigation elements. But what it gains in cleanliness, it lacks in immediate usability.</p>

<p>As an iOS developer, I try to find ways to make apps intuitive to people without having to use a tutorial. In general, this means avoiding the less obvious touch gestures and swiping a list and dragging items are essentially the only two items in my gesture toolbox. My users should be able to tell me what they can do in a screen easily, with minimal experimentation.</p>

<p>So back to my dilemma: I enjoy using Clear myself and I wish I could add touch gestures into any app I build because they are quite useful for getting rid of extra navigation elements. But I can&rsquo;t, not yet at least.</p>

<p>While watching user testing it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that the majority of people don&rsquo;t automatically understand most touch gestures. Even if you teach them how to navigate by swiping back and forth, it&rsquo;s not easily memorable and it surely doesn&rsquo;t remind users what to do when they&rsquo;re faced with the problem down the road.</p>

<p>Apple has approached this problem in their apps using both methods. There is always a longer flow that takes you through an edit or delete button where the interactions are almost tap-exclusive and, in apps that have extra polish, you can generally swipe or three-finger-something to bypass those extra steps if you know how.</p>

<p>This seems to be the most reasoned approach. Let power users have their quick methods while retaining easy discoverability for novice users.</p>

<p>But is this a long term solution or just a bridge to a world where everyone knows how to swipe to delete?</p>

<p>Clear would play an important role to force users towards a better understanding of possible touch gestures in the latter case, while in the former they simply target power users exclusively.</p>

<p>While I like the idea of this being some middleground before we&rsquo;re all touch gesture-aware, I don&rsquo;t see that as a realistic vision.</p>

<p>What makes products like the iPad special is that anyone can pick them up and roughly know how to operate a well-built app. We&rsquo;ve seen this again and again with babies (and cats) and anyone else who has never used an iPad. It&rsquo;s just natural to use those few core gestures. Removing functionality unless you know secret swipe zones is going against this principle.</p>

<p>If gestures are going to be the only way to navigate, we have to at least make them discoverable &ndash; and not by tutorial. Something must remind us that an action can be taken here.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think icons fill this role very well as one has to learn what the icons represent. And whatever solution is correct will not be based on a purely Apple aesthetic, it has to work across any touch device.</p>

<p>Are there any apps that do a particularly good job at both using different touch gestures and informing users about them?</p>

			The Personal Analytics of Stephen Wolfram</a>

		<p>The kind of data that Stephen Wolfram collects about himself is absolutely mind-boggling. Here he writes a post about data he&apos;s collected, most of it dating back to the early 90s.</p>

<p>I wonder what kind of time he spends getting the systems in place to log, for example, every keystroke he&apos;s ever typed. I like to look back on data and note interesting events and patterns that mean something but I wouldn&apos;t spend any measure of time to set something up for a few extra data points down the road. His blog post doesn&apos;t come any closer to explaining his reasoning for logging everything or what he gets out of it, but I assume it&apos;s something that he enjoys given the amount of effort put in.</p>

<p>&gt; I only remember feeling like I had just had an excellent cup of coffee, but without the caffeine jitters. I felt clear-headed and like myself, just sharper. Calmer. Without fear and without doubt. From there on, I just spent the time waiting for a problem to appear so that I could solve it.</p>

<p>I don&apos;t know a single geek who hasn&apos;t wanted this. Geek life is all about learning new things constantly and developing the talents to tune out all the noise is a part of the process. I would pay handsomely to be able to push a button to get into the zone on an otherwise noisy day.</p>

<p>The best part about this is that it&apos;s really not super expensive.

There are plenty of more expensive hobbies.</p>

		<p>Jesse Thorn (I think I&apos;ve mentioned <a href="http://putthison.com/">Put This On</a> before but he can adequately be described as a public radio nerd regardless of if you&apos;ve heard him before) write about <em>things</em> &ndash; methods, outlooks, etc &ndash; that you should do to Make Your Thing. They&apos;re all great notes about specific people who are successful at doing what they care about.</p>

<p>Being Jesse Thorn must be really fascinating. He&apos;s one of these people that is involved random projects from all over. Every time I find a new interesting internet show or podcast there&apos;s a good 50/50 chance that Jesse has had a hand in it. He&apos;s also had a radio show since he was 19 &ndash; the same one, albeit with a slightly different name or content &ndash; and that takes some enviable dedication to have done something for eleven years straight. I wonder what kind of inspiration he had growing up to develop such awesome habits.</p>
