			Annual Business Registration Scam</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the downsides to officially registering with the state as a business is that your address is added to yet another public list and various types of spam increase, regardless of your business&#8217; purpose. Not a huge deal &ndash; this is what the recycling pile is for, right?</p>

<p>I recently received a letter that is actually a problem. It purports to be from an &ldquo;Annual Business Registration&rdquo; office and suggests that you need to pay some amount of money ($218, in my case) and then there&rsquo;s some fear-inducing talk about suspension of your business if you don&rsquo;t file your Statement of Information.</p>

<p>Part of this is true! A Statement of Information does have to be filed with the state in a timely manner and you can be fined for not filing. However, this form is <em>not</em> a statement of information, it&rsquo;s a scam.</p>

<p>The letterhead looks vaguely state-like with a modified California seal (without the term &ldquo;The Great Seal…&rdquo; since it very clearly isn&rsquo;t the actual seal). It includes your business name and LLC number, plus the amount of money you &ldquo;need&rdquo; to pay and a P.O. Box to send your payment to. For reference, here&rsquo;s the address:</p>

<blockquote><p>Annual Business Registration<br/>
P.O. Box 931597<br/>
Los Angeles, CA 90093</p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever you do, do not send your money here. There is no state business registration office in Los Angeles and you will not be penalized for disregarding this piece of junk mail.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/annual-review-board-los-angeles?sort_by=date_desc">Yelp</a>, this exact scam without any modification has been occurring since at least 2009. Is there nothing illegal about deceptively suggesting that the owner here is associated with the state?</p>

			White House Beer Recipes</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been brewing beer at home since the spring so it was pretty cool to see the White House staff getting into brewing and then releasing their own <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/09/01/ale-chief-white-house-beer-recipe">recipes for Honey Ale and Honey Porter</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to pick up the ingredients for the porter and try it out &ndash; I&rsquo;m sure the <a href="http://www.sanfranciscobrewcraft.com/">Brewcraft store in SF</a> (where I get all my recipes) is getting plenty of requests for those ingredients. So far I&rsquo;ve made a Pale Ale (decent!), an Amber Ale (slightly watery), a Pilsner (tasty but slightly overcarbonated) and an IPA is almost ready to be bottled.</p>

<p>Echoing Sam Kass (White House assistant chef), it&rsquo;s surprisingly easy to make a really tasty beer at home. I would suggest two things if you&rsquo;re new to brewing: get the supplies to do primary and secondary fermentation and pay attention to your sanitization. Transfering to a second container after a few days will get your beer off the dead yeast which can give off weird flavors (there are simple brewing methods that use a single container for all fermentation before the bottle). Keeping equipment sanitized through the entire process is not hard but you have to pay attention to what tools are in a clean state and only use those on your clean equipment (or resanitize them). Wild yeasts and bacteria are everywhere and a batch of fermenting beer can be a pretty ideal place for unpleasant things to grow.</p>

<p>Go forth and brew White House beer!</p>

			SSD + Thunderbolt = Speed</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been eyeballing external Thunderbolt enclosures ever since I started running my iMac startup disk off a separate SSD. It was sitting in an old USB 2.0 enclosure but not only did it take up a precious USB slot but because SSD read/write speeds can out perform USB 2.0 transfer speeds it also wasn&rsquo;t reaching its true potential, a turn of phrase I&rsquo;m all too familiar with from high school.</p>

<p>I had opened up my mid-2011 iMac a while back to see how hard it was to implant the SSD into space that I knew was reserved for such a thing. Perhaps as a warning of things to come, the guts of this computer are an impenetrable fortress &ndash; I got as far as having to take the entire logic board out before I bailed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m usually pretty comfortable taking stuff apart but the iMac felt so delicately put together with every wire in its proper place that I decided it was not worth the cost of breaking something. A fear perhaps perpetuated by my experience replacing my home button on my iPhone (so many tiny screws!) in which I didn&rsquo;t properly thread a ribbon cable and ended up tearing the thing in two and having to replace the screen entirely. It was frustrating but cheaper to fix than a similar potential problem in the iMac.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how I got stuck with the USB enclosure which, for most purposes, has still been a great improvement over spinning disks. Even if I&rsquo;m maxing out the USB transfer speed, I was getting much better performance than I would on a standard disk.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not good enough for nerds. Not. At. All.</p>

<p>My options for SSD enclosures were pretty limited until recently. Everything from LaCie looks nice but is pretty expensive and they insist on bundling spinning disks with the damn enclosure. Elgato has one that ships with an SSD but no empty option and I&rsquo;ve already had an off-brand SSD fail on me so no thanks, I&rsquo;ll bring my own.</p>

<p>Enter Buffalo Technology. They make routers and hard drives and various internal components… your standard modern computer component manufacturer. And their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008D4X9VC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008D4X9VC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=finestru-20">MiniStation Thunderbolt drive</a> (kickback link) is inexpensive enough to warrant taking apart, or so I thought. Also Amazon has the terrible habit of delivering most of my prime items next day, which is probably why I made the impulse purchase in the first place.</p>

<p>In short, this enclosure is not designed to be taken apart, by anyone, ever. Why would you ship an enclosure with two incredibly fast communication channels and then toss some slow spinning disk in it and top the whole thing off with super strong adhesive, plenty of screws and enough clips to secure the thing during liftoff to Mars? My guess is that they just don&rsquo;t know how many people are looking for something external to put their SSD inside. Or its a hardware test run for more dual thunderbolt/usb3 components down the line.</p>

<p>Do I have a working thunderbolt enclosure with an SSD now? Yes, it&rsquo;s awesome. Did I struggle to extricate the guts out of it in the first place? Absolutely. I do not recommend it for those uncomfortable with a lot of prying at new hardware. I put a few scratches on the case.</p>

<p>Verdict: purchase only if you are desperate, or if your inner nerd is nagging at you. It came with a thunderbolt cable, at least.</p>

			Go-powered Beer at Original Gravity Pub</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last month saw the official opening of San Jose&rsquo;s newest drinking establishment, <a href="http://www.originalgravitypub.com/">Original Gravity Public House</a>. Dan is a friend from before he became a full-time beer slinger and I offered to whip up something for the website a while back.</p>

<p>As a craft beer bar they had the opportunity to change their selection of beers regularly and wanted a way to reflect those changes on their website and in the bar with minimal effort. You can see the virtual result on their website which has an up-to-date list of all their current beers. The other solution was showing a list of all their current beers on a 40&#8221; TV above the bar, you can see a picture of how it turned out here:</p>

<p><span class="blogimage">
<img src="http://blog.nickoneill.name/images/ogtv.jpg" alt="Original Gravity Beer List" /><br />
From <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uXCsgEdownjTGlQtnWvkjQ?select=Gxg_cJOzDkKUv8pnprOiBQ#Gxg_cJOzDkKUv8pnprOiBQ">Yelp</a>
</span></p>

<p>Designing for a big screen TV is not something I remember doing since webTV stopped being <em>a thing</em>. It was a fun exercise in scaling and clarity, and it seems like it has been successful so far.</p>

<p>The behind-the-scenes wiring is pretty minimal. I built a small Go-powered web service that allows Dan to add to, remove from and reorder the beer list which is written to disk. Whenever an item changes, templates are built and put in their proper locations. Static publishing at its best.</p>

<p>The bar view on the TV is just a fullscreen view of a special website in Chrome, it periodically refreshes to pick up the updated beer list. Nothing is particularly complex about the system, just adding together all the right components. I&rsquo;ve been spending more time writing servers and other tools in Go so this was a good way to learn more of the standard library. As far as I know this is the first Go-powered craft beer bar, though I haven&rsquo;t spent a lot of time asking around at bars.</p>

<p>Dan and friends at Original Gravity have a really welcoming space and some very tasty beers on tap. Stop by if you need a drink in San Jose!</p>
