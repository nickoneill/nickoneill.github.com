		<p>Good day, blog friends!</p>

<p>Not counting <a href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/muniverse-2.html">Muniverse</a> (and I don&rsquo;t, it was waiting to be published for a while), it has been quite a time since I last wrote a thing. Here&rsquo;s some stuff that doesn&rsquo;t warrant its own post:</p>

<p>Brad and I finally finished a remote garage door opener based on an Arduino and WiFly. See the incredible frustration documented on G+ <a href="https://plus.google.com/115863474911002159675/posts/2PSkLbtUJRB">here</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/115863474911002159675/posts/WCen2ZJE9vz">here</a>. A few more tweaks and the whole thing will be on github.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m doing some more frequent science tweeting with <a href="https://twitter.com/finestructure">@finestructure</a>. I never realized I felt a little trapped in my regular twitter account, I&rsquo;m not an oversharer and I don&rsquo;t like to innundate my friends with dumb stuff. Strangers, on the other hand, love dumb stuff. Seriously though, it&rsquo;s full of excellent science and snark.</p>

<p>I want to get back to blogging more on the proper Fine Structure blog but I&rsquo;m frustrated with my publishing setup there. I want to adapt <a href="https://github.com/nickoneill/go-publisher">my dropbox static publisher</a> for this purpose but it requires some thinking, generalizing and coding. Maybe during vacation, or after I write some content.</p>

<p>Work continues to be enjoyable. There are many ways to run a small contracting business and my current method involves doing enough directly billable work to be comfortable and then investing the rest of my time in learning new things &ndash; not always directly related to work. I don&rsquo;t think I could ever swing a deal like that at a standard salaried job so I think I&rsquo;ll be doing this for a while.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m spending a bit of time playing <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a> (as little time as someone can spend and still improve in the Most Complex Game Ever). I tend to leave it alone for a few weeks then see something that inspires me to start a new fort, play that for a few days and get totally destroyed by a seige of undead. Such is life in the DF. I would very much like to try a Let&rsquo;s Play video for DF so we&rsquo;ll see where that idea goes in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>I started writing about my current reading list here but it ran far too long, that will have to come at a later date. Welcome back, blog!</p>

			Muniverse 2</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Many years ago as I was learning Objective-C and Jamison was going through his public transit phase (yes, as far as I know he&rsquo;s still in it), we joined forces to create an epic San Francisco Muni app for the iPhone.</p>

<p>It was my first ground-up project for the iPhone so I found myself wanting to rewrite large swaths of the code every 2-3 weeks. For obvious reasons, I tried to keep the stuff that was ugly but effective and that got us to the release. Unfortunately it was little help for keeping things updated as any Muni route changes were a big pain to incorporate. Eventually new versions of iOS deprecated bits and pieces of APIs we were using and new APIs replaced them. After a while the app started crashing on startup and I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to debug (my) ancient newbie code.</p>

<p>The original Muniverse has since been removed from the app store for those reasons (interestingly, Apple doesn&rsquo;t seem to care if a previously approved app starts crashing on new iOS versions). However, I still stand by our goals for the project; find when your bus or train or street car arrives in the least amount of taps. We literally want you to be in the app for as little time as possible (but every day, of course).</p>

<p>Looking at other Muni apps since then, it&rsquo;s pretty sad to be a rider with an iPhone. Everyone has clunky methods for finding your stops (be they map-oriented or otherwise) and no one makes it as easy as Muniverse to get times for the stop you use every single day. Most of the apps are clearly built by people who don&rsquo;t live in San Francisco or who don&rsquo;t use Muni often enough to know the weird configuration for the KT or which stop names are wrong when they come out of the NextBus API.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why Jamison and I have rethought Muniverse from the ground up and are happy to report that an all new Muniverse is currently on the app store. For free.</p>

<p>Why rerelease Muniverse? We both feel that having a showpiece for our separate skills on the App Store is a great example to show potential clients. Jamison&rsquo;s UI/UX contributions are obvious when using the app, though the code is a bit more difficult to evaluate even if the app works as intended.</p>

<p>Rewriting everything gave me an opportunity to explore some of the modern Objective-C features that can make development easier and faster. Muniverse uses storyboards, core data, new literals and eventually will integrate with the new transit routing APIs. To better illustrate my side of the development process and provide a complete, modern reference for those who are learning Objective-C, <a href="https://github.com/nickoneill/Muniverse2">the entire codebase is on github</a>.</p>

<p>However, the open source license doesn&rsquo;t cover everything since we don&rsquo;t want anyone to re-release the very same code as their own. The graphics are included in the project but are not licensed for use. In addition, there&rsquo;s some magic (written in Go) that generates a large file containing relevant information about all the stops and lines in Muniverse which isn&rsquo;t included in the repository. I think this serves the interests of all parties, providing a great mass of code for those who want to learn Objective-C while keeping blatant plagiarism at bay.</p>

<p>Lest you think this project was entirely for the good will of SFers and Obj-C newbies, let me be clear: this is an obvious ploy to bring in more work. Jamison works on UI/UX stuff as <a href="http://fattrash.com">Fat Trash Design</a> and he&rsquo;s highly recommended if you need this kind of work done. I run a small iOS development shop called <a href="http://launchapps.net">Launch Apps</a> (yay placeholder website!) doing contract work for big and small companies alike. Feel free to get in touch if you like Muniverse and want to see the same level of quality in your own mobile apps.</p>

		<p>This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ssc1GsqHds">youtube video from NASA</a> shows a galactic simulation for approximately 13.5 Billion years. While watching galaxies tear each other apart is fun and all, the fascinating part is that it is, after all, a simulation.</p>

<p>Take some physical rules and enough processing power and you can simulate 13.5 Billion years of dust coming together which in turn attracts more dust and creates stars which attracts more dust which creates young stars which… you get the idea.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly citizen science (which I&rsquo;d like to see on Kickstarter some day) but it&rsquo;s a great start if you want to be involved with funding an awesome science and technology project and get interesting updates along the way.</p>

<p>Ignore their standard science company website and the slightly awkward funding video and back their awesome project today!</p>

<p>Update: They were successful! They&rsquo;ve done a really great job of keeping backers up-to-date on the project so far, I think this is a great model for science on Kickstarter.</p>

			Annual Business Registration Scam</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the downsides to officially registering with the state as a business is that your address is added to yet another public list and various types of spam increase, regardless of your business&#8217; purpose. Not a huge deal &ndash; this is what the recycling pile is for, right?</p>

<p>I recently received a letter that is actually a problem. It purports to be from an &ldquo;Annual Business Registration&rdquo; office and suggests that you need to pay some amount of money ($218, in my case) and then there&rsquo;s some fear-inducing talk about suspension of your business if you don&rsquo;t file your Statement of Information.</p>

<p>Part of this is true! A Statement of Information does have to be filed with the state in a timely manner and you can be fined for not filing. However, this form is <em>not</em> a statement of information, it&rsquo;s a scam.</p>

<p>The letterhead looks vaguely state-like with a modified California seal (without the term &ldquo;The Great Seal…&rdquo; since it very clearly isn&rsquo;t the actual seal). It includes your business name and LLC number, plus the amount of money you &ldquo;need&rdquo; to pay and a P.O. Box to send your payment to. For reference, here&rsquo;s the address:</p>

<blockquote><p>Annual Business Registration<br/>
P.O. Box 931597<br/>
Los Angeles, CA 90093</p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever you do, do not send your money here. There is no state business registration office in Los Angeles and you will not be penalized for disregarding this piece of junk mail.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/annual-review-board-los-angeles?sort_by=date_desc">Yelp</a>, this exact scam without any modification has been occurring since at least 2009. Is there nothing illegal about deceptively suggesting that the owner here is associated with the state?</p>

			White House Beer Recipes</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been brewing beer at home since the spring so it was pretty cool to see the White House staff getting into brewing and then releasing their own <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/09/01/ale-chief-white-house-beer-recipe">recipes for Honey Ale and Honey Porter</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to pick up the ingredients for the porter and try it out &ndash; I&rsquo;m sure the <a href="http://www.sanfranciscobrewcraft.com/">Brewcraft store in SF</a> (where I get all my recipes) is getting plenty of requests for those ingredients. So far I&rsquo;ve made a Pale Ale (decent!), an Amber Ale (slightly watery), a Pilsner (tasty but slightly overcarbonated) and an IPA is almost ready to be bottled.</p>

<p>Echoing Sam Kass (White House assistant chef), it&rsquo;s surprisingly easy to make a really tasty beer at home. I would suggest two things if you&rsquo;re new to brewing: get the supplies to do primary and secondary fermentation and pay attention to your sanitization. Transfering to a second container after a few days will get your beer off the dead yeast which can give off weird flavors (there are simple brewing methods that use a single container for all fermentation before the bottle). Keeping equipment sanitized through the entire process is not hard but you have to pay attention to what tools are in a clean state and only use those on your clean equipment (or resanitize them). Wild yeasts and bacteria are everywhere and a batch of fermenting beer can be a pretty ideal place for unpleasant things to grow.</p>

<p>Go forth and brew White House beer!</p>

			SSD + Thunderbolt = Speed</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been eyeballing external Thunderbolt enclosures ever since I started running my iMac startup disk off a separate SSD. It was sitting in an old USB 2.0 enclosure but not only did it take up a precious USB slot but because SSD read/write speeds can out perform USB 2.0 transfer speeds it also wasn&rsquo;t reaching its true potential, a turn of phrase I&rsquo;m all too familiar with from high school.</p>

<p>I had opened up my mid-2011 iMac a while back to see how hard it was to implant the SSD into space that I knew was reserved for such a thing. Perhaps as a warning of things to come, the guts of this computer are an impenetrable fortress &ndash; I got as far as having to take the entire logic board out before I bailed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m usually pretty comfortable taking stuff apart but the iMac felt so delicately put together with every wire in its proper place that I decided it was not worth the cost of breaking something. A fear perhaps perpetuated by my experience replacing my home button on my iPhone (so many tiny screws!) in which I didn&rsquo;t properly thread a ribbon cable and ended up tearing the thing in two and having to replace the screen entirely. It was frustrating but cheaper to fix than a similar potential problem in the iMac.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how I got stuck with the USB enclosure which, for most purposes, has still been a great improvement over spinning disks. Even if I&rsquo;m maxing out the USB transfer speed, I was getting much better performance than I would on a standard disk.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not good enough for nerds. Not. At. All.</p>

<p>My options for SSD enclosures were pretty limited until recently. Everything from LaCie looks nice but is pretty expensive and they insist on bundling spinning disks with the damn enclosure. Elgato has one that ships with an SSD but no empty option and I&rsquo;ve already had an off-brand SSD fail on me so no thanks, I&rsquo;ll bring my own.</p>

<p>Enter Buffalo Technology. They make routers and hard drives and various internal components… your standard modern computer component manufacturer. And their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008D4X9VC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008D4X9VC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=finestru-20">MiniStation Thunderbolt drive</a> (kickback link) is inexpensive enough to warrant taking apart, or so I thought. Also Amazon has the terrible habit of delivering most of my prime items next day, which is probably why I made the impulse purchase in the first place.</p>

<p>In short, this enclosure is not designed to be taken apart, by anyone, ever. Why would you ship an enclosure with two incredibly fast communication channels and then toss some slow spinning disk in it and top the whole thing off with super strong adhesive, plenty of screws and enough clips to secure the thing during liftoff to Mars? My guess is that they just don&rsquo;t know how many people are looking for something external to put their SSD inside. Or its a hardware test run for more dual thunderbolt/usb3 components down the line.</p>

<p>Do I have a working thunderbolt enclosure with an SSD now? Yes, it&rsquo;s awesome. Did I struggle to extricate the guts out of it in the first place? Absolutely. I do not recommend it for those uncomfortable with a lot of prying at new hardware. I put a few scratches on the case.</p>

<p>Verdict: purchase only if you are desperate, or if your inner nerd is nagging at you. It came with a thunderbolt cable, at least.</p>
