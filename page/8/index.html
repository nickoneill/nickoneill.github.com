			The 2012 Update for Dwarf Fortress</a>

		<p>Insanity. This game always amazes me with its depth and complexity. The hardness of smelted ore is actually based on <a href="http://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/8014/1070">real stress/strain physics</a>:</p>

<p>&gt; When Toady redesigned the combat system in DF2010 (the successor to 40d), he changed it from a heuristic system (with values he decided on) to a system based on the properties of Yield, Fracture and Elasticity. He did this in an attempt to simulate proper Stress/Strain equations. However, because Iron has poorer properties in comparison to Bronze, the result was the Iron Weapons/Armor are inferior to Bronze Weapons/Armor in DF2010</p>

<p>It&apos;s difficult to say if the confusing interface makes this game better (use your imagination, like text based games!) or if it only serves to limit the audience. At the very least, I can imagine a Sim Dwarf City doing very well on the app store.</p>

			In Time</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637688/">In Time</a> turned out to be a movie that relied far too heavily on making time puns. As for the plot, there are about a million ways one can make an interesting scifi storyline with immortality <em>and</em> time-as-currency but the writer/director managed to keep everything pretty shallow.</p>

<p>Speaking of, writing <em>and</em> directing a film seems like a Lucas-esque control freak move. You&rsquo;re the best writer you could convince to do your movie? Unlikely. And the best director? These odds are not getting better. Don&rsquo;t even get me started on people who write/direct/star.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of Matt Bomer on <em>White Collar</em> so I was disappointed by his lack of screen time. He may have been the only character in the entire film with clear motivations, though that may have been simply a side effect of being a chracter who dies early.</p>

<p>In conclusion, do not watch.</p>

		<p>Yes, they make 50 thousand ton presses. They&apos;re used for making all sorts of parts that you don&apos;t want to welt or bolt together. This particular machine was built in 1955 and its relevance is impressive:</p>

<p>&gt;Every manned U.S. military aircraft now flying uses parts forged by the Fifty. So does every commercial aircraft made by Airbus and Boeing.</p>

<p>How many other commercial machines built in 1955 are still in use today, let alone being used for some of the most cutting edge machines?</p>

<p>I love giant machines like this one because they stand as large and imposing as a particle accelerator but in a totally different context.</p>

			A Personal Virtual Space</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>High above the surrounding forrest, a <a href="http://imgur.com/a/1DhuT">small wooden house sits on a pillar of stone</a><sup>1</sup>. It has a single inhabitant who visits daily to improve on the structure and explore the world, often bringing back rare materials from mines underground or far away lands. For as far as we can compute, this land is devoid of any other humans or human-built structures. Sometimes a few friends visit, popping in and out of existence nearby and making their way to the sole pillar of sentience in a vast blockscape of computer generated valleys and oceans.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not an unlikely paragraph in an average internet-era scifi novel. The idea of visiting the virtual world of a friend seems like old news when you take the concept of 3D first-person exploration, the ability to connect with a friend from anywhere on the planet via the internet and the basic need for users to have a place to call home. Despite this, Personal Virtual Spaces have remained elusive to the average internet user &ndash; at least in any form that puts users first.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say there haven&rsquo;t been attempts. In fact, most massively multiplayer games have some sense of &ldquo;home&rdquo; for the user but these features are bolted on and mostly used as extra storage for RPG-style games. Like so many things, it seems that the harder a game tries to implement a personal space the harder they fail at actually doing so.</p>

<p>Minecraft, on the other hand, is the first real success at having your own world that you can share with friends. And it succeeds at the concept because it tries the <em>least</em>. The game simply gives users the tools to connect and persist and the rest is so open ended that it manages to achieve the goals of anyone who cares to be there. As long as you like adventure or creativity, you can like Minecraft.</p>

<p>I would be mistaken to not mention <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/markpasc/p/treehouses-online-community-for-internet">Mark&rsquo;s Treehouses presentation</a>. I think Mark has some incredibly useful ideas for what could make an intentionally successful PVS product (Minecraft being unintentional, as far as I know), combining knowledge of what Minecraft, Second Life, MUDS and most notably Animal Crossing do correctly and incorrectly. Kids with access to the internet grow up with these limited vitual spaces and it only serves to prime a new generation for more of those types of social interactions over the internet. I think there is a clearly growing segment of internet users who want and would use a well designed PVS on a regular basis.</p>

<p>I have little doubt that there will be more products trying out this space in the near future but there are still lots of questions about how this will materialize. Glitch has seen some success with their web-based Flash 2D world but standards for WebGL (and most recently <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2012/02/gpu-accelerating-2d-canvas-and-enabling.html">hardware-accelerated 2D canvas</a>) are making native 3D games in the browser a very real possibility. And there&rsquo;s always room for more social creativity on the web.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Not mine but pretty cool, right?</p>

			Geeks on Homes</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		Let me tell you about the nerdiest show on television.

It&#8217;s not a sci-fi miniseries or a space documentary, or even Mythbusters as you might imagine. It&#8217;s *Holmes on Homes*. And yes, this means I watch HGTV.

At first glance it&#8217;s your typical construction/remodel show. It adds the element of &#8220;something went wrong&#8221; by selecting regular people who have paid local contractors to fix or remodel something and the contractor has either done clearly shitty work or left without finishing the job. Enter Mike Holmes, apparently the only proper contractor in Canada and generally burly dude. He assesses the damage and then his team tears everything down (usually finding more things to fix in the process) and rebuilds it by the end of the hour.

Emotional fluff, I say. The general overview does not paint a very nerdy picture for this show.

The nerdy part is the teardown and rebuild process. As they remove the offending staircase/bathroom/structure from the house, Holmes gives a fairly succinct description of why the problem occurred. If there&#8217;s a leak underneath a shower, it&#8217;s probably because the shower doesn&#8217;t drain properly. That&#8217;s somewhat obvious and I&#8217;m no construction buff but this reasoning is oddly satisfying.

Taking a peek behind the walls of your house, everything is set up *just so* and clearly there are some rules governing this design of wood, wires and pipes. What those rules said, on the other hand, were completely beyond me until I started watching this show.

As it turns out, these rules are pretty logical. Don&#8217;t put hot stuff next to flammable stuff, don&#8217;t put electrical stuff next to other conductive stuff, the shit should always flow downward; I&#8217;m not 100% sure about what the code says exactly but as long as you know the properties of the items you&#8217;re working with, it&#8217;s not too difficult to envision the right solution.

One of the reasons I probably enjoy watching this show is that the process isn&#8217;t too dissimilar from coding. You learn the details of a particular implementation (how to build a shed, or oauth) and nail it together with some common tools (hammer, screwdriver, standard python syntax). You can do a shitty job by not understanding the problem or solution well enough, just as in code, but generally doing a good job on simple projects doesn&#8217;t require anything more than properly understanding what to expect from the pieces you&#8217;re fitting together.

I&#8217;m sure some thread of this connects back to the resurgence of DIY. At some point in time the need to make something was overwhelmed by grand idea of having it made for you, and then the giants of manufacturing removed quality as a standard in *the great cheapening* (note: this is a under-researched and probably not very accurate history of 20th century manufacturing). Now here we are, pissed with poor quality products and sheds that don&#8217;t survive a single San Francisco winter.

We&#8217;re equipped with the mental capacity to understand the rules governing scripts running on computers in a data center 3000 miles away, so why can&#8217;t we design and build our own damn shed? Yes, we&#8217;re geeks and nerds, not known for our brute strength - but wheels and pulleys solved the heavy lifting problems years ago, there really isn&#8217;t a reason not to build it yourself.

This was a long way to explain my love for *Holmes on Homes* (or the hour-long *Holmes Inspection* - how clever!) but I think it makes a deeper point about geeks getting into Making, and anyone else for that matter. There&#8217;s more to say on Making as a cultural phenomenon but I&#8217;ll leave that for another time.

For now: set the DVR for a Holmes show, don&#8217;t take it too seriously, and learn something from your TV.

			These Chromebooks</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		Let&#8217;s get back to nerdiness. And by nerdiness I mean freshly unwrapped hardware reviews for some new technology. **Chromebooks**, my friend. I have been using a classy (not Apple classy, but classy) Samsung 5 Chromebook since earlier this week and I&#8217;m going to tell you about it.

Before we begin to wax philosophical about the *purpose* of a Chromebook, let&#8217;s take a moment to understand the hardware. A very bright 12.1&#8221; screen with a very, *very* blue tinted LED backlight. The screen color is downright cold and it&#8217;s not because of all the blues and greys that Google likes to use in the Chrome interface. They keyboard is springy and clacky (in a good way), and it takes little to no effort to get used to once you accept the massive size of the CTRL and ALT keys. The whole thing is light as a feather and since the hard drive is purely solid state, you&#8217;ll have no issue throwing it around. It doesn&#8217;t feel as sturdy as a unibody machine but it&#8217;s about as solid as plastic construction gets and the components aren&#8217;t flopping around inside either.

The *trackpad*. Maybe I&#8217;m just ruined from using the glass trackpads on the Macbook Pros, so take this with a grain of salt: it&#8217;s like running your finger over broken glass whenever you want to move the cursor. That wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if it wasn&#8217;t for the windows-style keyboard commands. Pointer tactility aside, it functions not unlike a standard trackpad. Tap to click is not on by default. Apparently the trackpad software was awful on the Cr-48 machines and has improved by leaps and bounds.

And now things I haven&#8217;t used but am obligated to mention: two USB ports, headphone jack, totally weird display connector, sim card slot, SD card slot. Most of these ports are covered by those plastic semi-attached tabs that we all had on our cellphones in the late 90s. The power connector feels like something you&#8217;d use to plug in your fax machine. Luckily you don&#8217;t use it much.

Finally. ChromeOS. Software. The thing Google is good at.

The thing really does start up in 8 seconds. And most of the time it&#8217;s just asleep and waking takes one or two seconds. Setup is quick and pulls down most of the Chrome settings you care about (if you use Chrome and have sync on already). They, uh, teach you how to click with the trackpad during setup.

It&#8217;s fast. The UI is responsive and pages load as fast as you&#8217;re used to in Chrome. It is genuinely strange to be presented with a browser window that you can&#8217;t hide, but other than that it feels pretty natural. Most of the stuff you do is on the web anyway, right? YouTube videos play great at 720p in fullscreen mode. They might play better than they do on the Mac. Again, it&#8217;s the web. The standard Google apps work flawlessly.

Extensions and apps are compatible with existing stuff on the Chrome web store, so there&#8217;s no problem getting Flashblock installed or using that Pinboard extension you&#8217;re used to. Those are designed to fit in with your standard browsing experience, no problem there. But there&#8217;s still a big gap in applications that provide desktop-like functionality on a cloud-centric laptop. We all know that there are lots of tasks the Chromebook isn&#8217;t designed for but developing for the web should be something you can do on the web. Unfortunately, most typing apps are designed for text or can sync to cloud services where viewing HTML content is hard. The web has come a long way in the last few years (more on this another time) and it&#8217;s not unlikely that the next Textmate could be an open source, browser-based editor with lots of cloud functionality.

Google&#8217;s timing with Chromebooks couldn&#8217;t be more spot-on: HTML is more powerful than ever and the abilities lacking on a Chromebook today only make me excited for what web applications developers will create to solve these problems.

Oh, and developers: flip that developer mode switch before you even turn the thing on the first time. Nothing different except&#8230; yep, easy access to a command line.
