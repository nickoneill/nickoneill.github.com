			A Personal Virtual Space</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>High above the surrounding forrest, a <a href="http://imgur.com/a/1DhuT">small wooden house sits on a pillar of stone</a><sup>1</sup>. It has a single inhabitant who visits daily to improve on the structure and explore the world, often bringing back rare materials from mines underground or far away lands. For as far as we can compute, this land is devoid of any other humans or human-built structures. Sometimes a few friends visit, popping in and out of existence nearby and making their way to the sole pillar of sentience in a vast blockscape of computer generated valleys and oceans.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not an unlikely paragraph in an average internet-era scifi novel. The idea of visiting the virtual world of a friend seems like old news when you take the concept of 3D first-person exploration, the ability to connect with a friend from anywhere on the planet via the internet and the basic need for users to have a place to call home. Despite this, Personal Virtual Spaces have remained elusive to the average internet user &ndash; at least in any form that puts users first.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say there haven&rsquo;t been attempts. In fact, most massively multiplayer games have some sense of &ldquo;home&rdquo; for the user but these features are bolted on and mostly used as extra storage for RPG-style games. Like so many things, it seems that the harder a game tries to implement a personal space the harder they fail at actually doing so.</p>

<p>Minecraft, on the other hand, is the first real success at having your own world that you can share with friends. And it succeeds at the concept because it tries the <em>least</em>. The game simply gives users the tools to connect and persist and the rest is so open ended that it manages to achieve the goals of anyone who cares to be there. As long as you like adventure or creativity, you can like Minecraft.</p>

<p>I would be mistaken to not mention <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/markpasc/p/treehouses-online-community-for-internet">Mark&rsquo;s Treehouses presentation</a>. I think Mark has some incredibly useful ideas for what could make an intentionally successful PVS product (Minecraft being unintentional, as far as I know), combining knowledge of what Minecraft, Second Life, MUDS and most notably Animal Crossing do correctly and incorrectly. Kids with access to the internet grow up with these limited vitual spaces and it only serves to prime a new generation for more of those types of social interactions over the internet. I think there is a clearly growing segment of internet users who want and would use a well designed PVS on a regular basis.</p>

<p>I have little doubt that there will be more products trying out this space in the near future but there are still lots of questions about how this will materialize. Glitch has seen some success with their web-based Flash 2D world but standards for WebGL (and most recently <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2012/02/gpu-accelerating-2d-canvas-and-enabling.html">hardware-accelerated 2D canvas</a>) are making native 3D games in the browser a very real possibility. And there&rsquo;s always room for more social creativity on the web.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Not mine but pretty cool, right?</p>

			Geeks on Homes</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		Let me tell you about the nerdiest show on television.

It&#8217;s not a sci-fi miniseries or a space documentary, or even Mythbusters as you might imagine. It&#8217;s *Holmes on Homes*. And yes, this means I watch HGTV.

At first glance it&#8217;s your typical construction/remodel show. It adds the element of &#8220;something went wrong&#8221; by selecting regular people who have paid local contractors to fix or remodel something and the contractor has either done clearly shitty work or left without finishing the job. Enter Mike Holmes, apparently the only proper contractor in Canada and generally burly dude. He assesses the damage and then his team tears everything down (usually finding more things to fix in the process) and rebuilds it by the end of the hour.

Emotional fluff, I say. The general overview does not paint a very nerdy picture for this show.

The nerdy part is the teardown and rebuild process. As they remove the offending staircase/bathroom/structure from the house, Holmes gives a fairly succinct description of why the problem occurred. If there&#8217;s a leak underneath a shower, it&#8217;s probably because the shower doesn&#8217;t drain properly. That&#8217;s somewhat obvious and I&#8217;m no construction buff but this reasoning is oddly satisfying.

Taking a peek behind the walls of your house, everything is set up *just so* and clearly there are some rules governing this design of wood, wires and pipes. What those rules said, on the other hand, were completely beyond me until I started watching this show.

As it turns out, these rules are pretty logical. Don&#8217;t put hot stuff next to flammable stuff, don&#8217;t put electrical stuff next to other conductive stuff, the shit should always flow downward; I&#8217;m not 100% sure about what the code says exactly but as long as you know the properties of the items you&#8217;re working with, it&#8217;s not too difficult to envision the right solution.

One of the reasons I probably enjoy watching this show is that the process isn&#8217;t too dissimilar from coding. You learn the details of a particular implementation (how to build a shed, or oauth) and nail it together with some common tools (hammer, screwdriver, standard python syntax). You can do a shitty job by not understanding the problem or solution well enough, just as in code, but generally doing a good job on simple projects doesn&#8217;t require anything more than properly understanding what to expect from the pieces you&#8217;re fitting together.

I&#8217;m sure some thread of this connects back to the resurgence of DIY. At some point in time the need to make something was overwhelmed by grand idea of having it made for you, and then the giants of manufacturing removed quality as a standard in *the great cheapening* (note: this is a under-researched and probably not very accurate history of 20th century manufacturing). Now here we are, pissed with poor quality products and sheds that don&#8217;t survive a single San Francisco winter.

We&#8217;re equipped with the mental capacity to understand the rules governing scripts running on computers in a data center 3000 miles away, so why can&#8217;t we design and build our own damn shed? Yes, we&#8217;re geeks and nerds, not known for our brute strength - but wheels and pulleys solved the heavy lifting problems years ago, there really isn&#8217;t a reason not to build it yourself.

This was a long way to explain my love for *Holmes on Homes* (or the hour-long *Holmes Inspection* - how clever!) but I think it makes a deeper point about geeks getting into Making, and anyone else for that matter. There&#8217;s more to say on Making as a cultural phenomenon but I&#8217;ll leave that for another time.

For now: set the DVR for a Holmes show, don&#8217;t take it too seriously, and learn something from your TV.

		<a href="/chromebooks/">
		
			These Chromebooks</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		Let&#8217;s get back to nerdiness. And by nerdiness I mean freshly unwrapped hardware reviews for some new technology. **Chromebooks**, my friend. I have been using a classy (not Apple classy, but classy) Samsung 5 Chromebook since earlier this week and I&#8217;m going to tell you about it.

Before we begin to wax philosophical about the *purpose* of a Chromebook, let&#8217;s take a moment to understand the hardware. A very bright 12.1&#8221; screen with a very, *very* blue tinted LED backlight. The screen color is downright cold and it&#8217;s not because of all the blues and greys that Google likes to use in the Chrome interface. They keyboard is springy and clacky (in a good way), and it takes little to no effort to get used to once you accept the massive size of the CTRL and ALT keys. The whole thing is light as a feather and since the hard drive is purely solid state, you&#8217;ll have no issue throwing it around. It doesn&#8217;t feel as sturdy as a unibody machine but it&#8217;s about as solid as plastic construction gets and the components aren&#8217;t flopping around inside either.

The *trackpad*. Maybe I&#8217;m just ruined from using the glass trackpads on the Macbook Pros, so take this with a grain of salt: it&#8217;s like running your finger over broken glass whenever you want to move the cursor. That wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if it wasn&#8217;t for the windows-style keyboard commands. Pointer tactility aside, it functions not unlike a standard trackpad. Tap to click is not on by default. Apparently the trackpad software was awful on the Cr-48 machines and has improved by leaps and bounds.

And now things I haven&#8217;t used but am obligated to mention: two USB ports, headphone jack, totally weird display connector, sim card slot, SD card slot. Most of these ports are covered by those plastic semi-attached tabs that we all had on our cellphones in the late 90s. The power connector feels like something you&#8217;d use to plug in your fax machine. Luckily you don&#8217;t use it much.

Finally. ChromeOS. Software. The thing Google is good at.

The thing really does start up in 8 seconds. And most of the time it&#8217;s just asleep and waking takes one or two seconds. Setup is quick and pulls down most of the Chrome settings you care about (if you use Chrome and have sync on already). They, uh, teach you how to click with the trackpad during setup.

It&#8217;s fast. The UI is responsive and pages load as fast as you&#8217;re used to in Chrome. It is genuinely strange to be presented with a browser window that you can&#8217;t hide, but other than that it feels pretty natural. Most of the stuff you do is on the web anyway, right? YouTube videos play great at 720p in fullscreen mode. They might play better than they do on the Mac. Again, it&#8217;s the web. The standard Google apps work flawlessly.

Extensions and apps are compatible with existing stuff on the Chrome web store, so there&#8217;s no problem getting Flashblock installed or using that Pinboard extension you&#8217;re used to. Those are designed to fit in with your standard browsing experience, no problem there. But there&#8217;s still a big gap in applications that provide desktop-like functionality on a cloud-centric laptop. We all know that there are lots of tasks the Chromebook isn&#8217;t designed for but developing for the web should be something you can do on the web. Unfortunately, most typing apps are designed for text or can sync to cloud services where viewing HTML content is hard. The web has come a long way in the last few years (more on this another time) and it&#8217;s not unlikely that the next Textmate could be an open source, browser-based editor with lots of cloud functionality.

Google&#8217;s timing with Chromebooks couldn&#8217;t be more spot-on: HTML is more powerful than ever and the abilities lacking on a Chromebook today only make me excited for what web applications developers will create to solve these problems.

Oh, and developers: flip that developer mode switch before you even turn the thing on the first time. Nothing different except&#8230; yep, easy access to a command line.

		<a href="/The+Failure+of+Founding+Users/">
		
			The Failure of Founding Users</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		A while back I tweeted a link to a project I was calling Founding Users. In short, the idea was that new startups needed a solid set of users that would use the product before anyone else and evangelize the product to others. It would employ in-person meetings where a few startups would pitch to a set of users who would eventually become the founding users for each startup.

I developed the idea a bit, set up a site to gauge interest and talked to some people who were better connected to the startup world than I. I have a bunch of existing projects going on that I didn&#8217;t want to ditch so the idea would have to be something that I could at least start in my spare time. Eventually, I decided that I didn&#8217;t have the existing social ties to make it work as a side project, it would probably require a good chunk of time to gather the resources to get started. The idea was fascinating to me, but it also wasn&#8217;t an idea I had any existing dedication or passion for, so the project died.

Founding Users is only the most recent unfinished project of mine, which might make some people cringe for lack of end results. While it might constitute a &#8220;failure&#8221; in that it never produced the results that it was intended for, I consider it as another important stepping-stone project. There were lots of interesting learning experiences along the way that I wouldn&#8217;t have had otherwise and that&#8217;s buildable knowledge.

[Time](http://amandahocking.blogspot.com/2011/03/some-things-that-need-to-be-said.html) and [time again](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/108606-Minecraft-Creator-Shows-Off-Early-Gaming-Projects) (these are just two examples I&#8217;ve seen over the last month), we&#8217;ve seen that success is not random chance or a single stroke of genius. It&#8217;s hard work over a long period of time and mostly filled with failures or unfinished works.

The idea that success is born of hard work isn&#8217;t new by any means, and I think you&#8217;d find it difficult to find someone who disagrees with that statement directly. Unfortunately, we (Americans, in this case, but it&#8217;s probably a not-uncommon cultural trait) have a terrible habit of condemning failure or half-finished works as a path you should not find yourself on. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s hard to explain: your half-finished projects don&#8217;t contribute to the progress of anyone other than yourself so it&#8217;s easy for an outsider to gain nothing from it and call it a waste of your time.

It&#8217;s easy for outsiders to think that someone stopped working on a project because they got bored or because they don&#8217;t have the drive to finish, and maybe that&#8217;s true in some cases, but I like to think that isn&#8217;t the reason most of the time. Regardless of the circumstance that led to a project prematurely ending, as long as you&#8217;re willing to look back and ponder truthfully about why the project ended and you still have the drive start something new, you&#8217;re on the right track.

The whole &#8220;ponder truthfully&#8221; thing is key. We (Humans? I&#8217;ll stick with cultural Americans, again) have a bit of a tendency to lie to ourselves about the reason things end, maybe because we&#8217;re fearful of failure in the first place. The opposite, of course, is people who feel more free to share the failures and abandoned projects, explaining the process in detail so others can learn from it. Then, even if no one learns anything specific from a failed project, others can start to see the failure that goes into success.

So, this is my first contribution. Here&#8217;s to Founding Users; not the first and surely not the last abandoned project.

			Make a Standing Desk From an Ikea Mikael</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		Standing desks are gaining popularity with the nerds who realize that their former sit-all-day behavior might be detrimental to their long-term health. I&#8217;m no exception to that realization but I wasn&#8217;t about to go out and buy a new desk without knowing how I&#8217;d feel standing all day. Luckily my desk was [cheapy simple mikael desk](http://www.google.com/images?q=ikea+mikael+desk) from Ikea that had lots of hack potential. This is definitely inspired by [Gina&#8217;s switcher post](http://smarterware.org/7102/how-and-why-i-switched-to-a-standing-desk) earlier this year as well.

Before doing any hacking though, I had to figure out just how high I wanted my desk surface. A couple books topped with a cutting board later, I found something pretty comfortable for me. I actually tried to look up a &#8220;best height&#8221; for typing at a standing desk but I couldn&#8217;t find any data to this effect. I ended up somewhere that felt comfortable, with my arms roughly resting at my sides.

I thought up a quick way to non-destructively prop my desk up another 11.5 inches with some 2x4s. Here&#8217;s a photo of the end result:

![My desk, standing on four legs](/images/standingdesk.jpg)

Some details: two 20&#8221; pieces of 2x4 are connected at the bottom by a slice of 2x4 about as thick as a the desk sides (1&#8221;3/8). The sides sit on four of these legs, supported 11.5&#8221; above the floor by a bolt that sits in two holes on either side of the leg. Nothing is drilled through the desk itself, it just sits on top. The bolts are tightened to hold the sides of the desk and the whole thing is surprisingly sturdy. Here&#8217;s some detail of a single leg:

![Detail for a single leg](/images/standingdesk-detail.jpg)

I&#8217;ve spent about 3 days working at the desk so far and I enjoy it quite a bit. It&#8217;s nice to be able to fidget and move about when you&#8217;re working. My feet hurt a bit but some well-supported shoes did a lot to help that out. I imagine that it&#8217;ll feel better after a week or so of standing up as well. One downside is that the cats have no lap to sit on.

I haven&#8217;t adjusted any of my monitors to eye-level as I&#8217;m not convinced it&#8217;s necessary. I don&#8217;t feel that I strain to look down at my displays so it hasn&#8217;t bothered me yet.

One thing I didn&#8217;t anticipate changing: Before the standing desk, I tended to get up in the mornings, grab some cereal and sit down at the computer and check emails or news. Now I&#8217;m less likely to want to stand at my desk right away so I can sit in the kitchen and eat something without refreshing facebook. It never quite felt like a compulsion but I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m doing something else first thing in the morning.

Hopefully I&#8217;ll remember to follow up to this post in a week or two. Ideally my feet will stop hurting entirely in another day or two, but the last couple days have been fairly busy with stuff to do away from the desk so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how a full day of typing feels in the coming week.

*Update 3/28:* Hey, I stand all day now and it&#8217;s pretty OK. Zero pain in my legs or back since about two weeks after I started standing, which was the only real downside. I did end up adjusting a monitor a bit closer to eye-level after a couple long days with few breaks left my neck hurting. I&#8217;m still enjoying it!

I could never remember the key command to type the right double angle quotes unicode symbol and I ended up searching the term on google endlessly because I used it just infrequently enough to prevent myself from developing any sort of muscle memory for it. The sites I always found were clearly autogenerated from some complete html entity reference and terrible to look at.

Enter [raquo.net](http://raquo.net). I figured that most web developers were in the same boat so I whipped up a quick design for a site that did nothing other than list some ways to access the symbol. Considering the non-existent competition it quickly became the top result for the search term &#8216;raquo&#8217; and - either for humor or utility - people started linking to it.

I know it lived in some obscurity for a while, I&#8217;ve owned the domain since January of &#8216;05 though it doesn&#8217;t show up on delicious until November of &#8216;06 and only 117 times since then. It&#8217;s a niche destination, for sure. Some might say that a site based on an html entity will always live in internet obscurity.

Sometime afterward I picked up [laquo.net](http://laquo.net), left double angle quotes, and [Jamison](http://www.fattrash.com) coined the term &#8216;the quo network&#8217; to make a media empire out of a molehill. Later, [kottke made a list](http://kottke.org/08/02/single-serving-sites) of &#8220;single serving&#8221; sites and someone made [a list of sites](http://www.alistofsites.com). Since then I added two single quote forms, [rsaquo](http://rsaquo.net) and [lsaquo](http://lsaquo.net) to round out my collection of angle quote domains.

I managed the lot of them in Movable Type for the longest time because it was (at the time) easy place to template a bunch of sites. I squirmed when I had to change something across them all a while back and put it off entirely when I realized the MT database I had used to create them was mothballed and would require setting up a completely new install and import.

Finally, I recently noticed two easy expansion &#8216;properties&#8217; recently that were at least equally and probably more useful than raquo, [rdquo](http://rdquo.net) and [ldquo](http://ldquo.net), the right and left double quotations. Maybe more functionally known as curly quotes, or pretty quotes (or those god damn microsoft word quotes). Inspired, I thought about how I would manage sites like these ideally and I ended up making a simple templating script in python with mustache and pushing each file out to the right place with rsync. That allowed me to create a couple more sites, the single quote versions [rsquo](http://rsquo.net) and [lsquo](http://lsquo.net), with even less effort.

As an aside, the scripts used to create and push these sites are all stored on [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) so I can essentially update the sites from any machine that has a Dropbox client and some open source software. You&#8217;ll probably hear more from me about Dropbox in the near future since my goal is to gain some independence from the device I&#8217;m currently working on. Ideally I&#8217;d be able to get a new computer, type my Dropbox password and start working like it was yesterday (yes, I *will* pay for that convenience).

I&#8217;ve looked around a bit now and I think these two sites are the last to make it into the network. There are no more useful quo entities (the low-9 versions of fancy quotes, sbquo and bdquo are hardly ever used) and the real icing on the cake, quot.net, has been registered for years and is probably unlikely to come up for registration any time soon.

Thus ends the developmental stage of the quo network. I&#8217;ll continue hosting the quo network as long as it doesn&#8217;t become a huge burden and, considering it essentially pays for my hosting every year, that shouldn&#8217;t be any time soon. Enjoy, internet.
