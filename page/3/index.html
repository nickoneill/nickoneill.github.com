			SSD + Thunderbolt = Speed</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been eyeballing external Thunderbolt enclosures ever since I started running my iMac startup disk off a separate SSD. It was sitting in an old USB 2.0 enclosure but not only did it take up a precious USB slot but because SSD read/write speeds can out perform USB 2.0 transfer speeds it also wasn&rsquo;t reaching its true potential, a turn of phrase I&rsquo;m all too familiar with from high school.</p>

<p>I had opened up my mid-2011 iMac a while back to see how hard it was to implant the SSD into space that I knew was reserved for such a thing. Perhaps as a warning of things to come, the guts of this computer are an impenetrable fortress &ndash; I got as far as having to take the entire logic board out before I bailed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m usually pretty comfortable taking stuff apart but the iMac felt so delicately put together with every wire in its proper place that I decided it was not worth the cost of breaking something. A fear perhaps perpetuated by my experience replacing my home button on my iPhone (so many tiny screws!) in which I didn&rsquo;t properly thread a ribbon cable and ended up tearing the thing in two and having to replace the screen entirely. It was frustrating but cheaper to fix than a similar potential problem in the iMac.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how I got stuck with the USB enclosure which, for most purposes, has still been a great improvement over spinning disks. Even if I&rsquo;m maxing out the USB transfer speed, I was getting much better performance than I would on a standard disk.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not good enough for nerds. Not. At. All.</p>

<p>My options for SSD enclosures were pretty limited until recently. Everything from LaCie looks nice but is pretty expensive and they insist on bundling spinning disks with the damn enclosure. Elgato has one that ships with an SSD but no empty option and I&rsquo;ve already had an off-brand SSD fail on me so no thanks, I&rsquo;ll bring my own.</p>

<p>Enter Buffalo Technology. They make routers and hard drives and various internal componentsâ€¦ your standard modern computer component manufacturer. And their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008D4X9VC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008D4X9VC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=finestru-20">MiniStation Thunderbolt drive</a> (kickback link) is inexpensive enough to warrant taking apart, or so I thought. Also Amazon has the terrible habit of delivering most of my prime items next day, which is probably why I made the impulse purchase in the first place.</p>

<p>In short, this enclosure is not designed to be taken apart, by anyone, ever. Why would you ship an enclosure with two incredibly fast communication channels and then toss some slow spinning disk in it and top the whole thing off with super strong adhesive, plenty of screws and enough clips to secure the thing during liftoff to Mars? My guess is that they just don&rsquo;t know how many people are looking for something external to put their SSD inside. Or its a hardware test run for more dual thunderbolt/usb3 components down the line.</p>

<p>Do I have a working thunderbolt enclosure with an SSD now? Yes, it&rsquo;s awesome. Did I struggle to extricate the guts out of it in the first place? Absolutely. I do not recommend it for those uncomfortable with a lot of prying at new hardware. I put a few scratches on the case.</p>

<p>Verdict: purchase only if you are desperate, or if your inner nerd is nagging at you. It came with a thunderbolt cable, at least.</p>

			Go-powered Beer at Original Gravity Pub</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last month saw the official opening of San Jose&rsquo;s newest drinking establishment, <a href="http://www.originalgravitypub.com/">Original Gravity Public House</a>. Dan is a friend from before he became a full-time beer slinger and I offered to whip up something for the website a while back.</p>

<p>As a craft beer bar they had the opportunity to change their selection of beers regularly and wanted a way to reflect those changes on their website and in the bar with minimal effort. You can see the virtual result on their website which has an up-to-date list of all their current beers. The other solution was showing a list of all their current beers on a 40&#8221; TV above the bar, you can see a picture of how it turned out here:</p>

<p><span class="blogimage">
<img src="http://blog.nickoneill.name/images/ogtv.jpg" alt="Original Gravity Beer List" /><br />
From <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uXCsgEdownjTGlQtnWvkjQ?select=Gxg_cJOzDkKUv8pnprOiBQ#Gxg_cJOzDkKUv8pnprOiBQ">Yelp</a>
</span></p>

<p>Designing for a big screen TV is not something I remember doing since webTV stopped being <em>a thing</em>. It was a fun exercise in scaling and clarity, and it seems like it has been successful so far.</p>

<p>The behind-the-scenes wiring is pretty minimal. I built a small Go-powered web service that allows Dan to add to, remove from and reorder the beer list which is written to disk. Whenever an item changes, templates are built and put in their proper locations. Static publishing at its best.</p>

<p>The bar view on the TV is just a fullscreen view of a special website in Chrome, it periodically refreshes to pick up the updated beer list. Nothing is particularly complex about the system, just adding together all the right components. I&rsquo;ve been spending more time writing servers and other tools in Go so this was a good way to learn more of the standard library. As far as I know this is the first Go-powered craft beer bar, though I haven&rsquo;t spent a lot of time asking around at bars.</p>

<p>Dan and friends at Original Gravity have a really welcoming space and some very tasty beers on tap. Stop by if you need a drink in San Jose!</p>

			Feature Detection With Objective-C</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>(I&rsquo;m at WWDC this week, I figure I should probably release something of my own)</em></p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t being completely modest when I recently <a href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/line-simplification.html">praised line simplification</a> for bringing a method to the masses. It&rsquo;s not a great example though, so let me explain in a little more detail.</p>

<p>For any large group of people interacting with a technology, the vast majority are using it as a means to an end. I say this in a positive way. In fact, one sign of a truly successful technology is when people can ignore the amazing technical steps that enable them to do things they couldn&rsquo;t otherwise do.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of technical chops. I don&rsquo;t know how to write my own touchscreen driver but I can make apps that run on an iPhone because of the abstraction given to me by Apple.</p>

<p>Apple happens to be particularly good at technical complexity abstraction but open source projects are my favorite examples of technical movement because they&rsquo;re not driven by an obvious monitary incentive (I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s an argument that OS is driven by ego, but let&rsquo;s move on).</p>

<p>Before javascript frameworks, a limited number of people were using (and hating) straight javascript for everything. jQuery may have not been the first framework but it was the most effective at abstracting the hard/dumb parts of javascript away so that it was less intimidating to write.</p>

<p>Considering that javascript is already one of the easiest languages to get started with (everybody already has an interpreter!), it&rsquo;s not much of a stretch to suggest that jQuery made more programmers.</p>

<p>Arduino has done the same thing for microcontrollers. I spent some time on microcontroller projects just before arduino hardware started gaining popularity and the technical challenges at the time were huge. It was incredibly difficult to get started without having a pool of knowledge across multiple domains.</p>

<p>Arduino gave people a device that didn&rsquo;t require testing and soldering before they were writing code and making things blink.</p>

<p>I think Arduino is still stronger on the hardware side than software (there are so many tiny rules in C one must knowâ€¦), but the adoption is amazing. It was difficult to turn around without smacking your head on an Arduino at Maker Faire this year.</p>

<p>The fascinating thing about these projects is that they didn&rsquo;t necessarily invent anything new. Touchscreens existed before the iPhone (though Apple made them suck less) but it wraped the experience in an intuitive way. Everyone wrote their own javascript framework for projects before jQuery, but they packaged it together and made it fast. Arduino just made hardware that had the exact functionality that hobbyists wanted.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a particular fan of one subgenre: Projects that take complex methods that exist in academic research and making them available in a familiar format. That brings me to my own project that I&rsquo;ve been working on for a while: <a href="http://github.com/nickoneill/LAFeatureDetection">Feature Detection</a>, which finds features in images programmatically.</p>

<p>The most obvious computational method of finding a feature in an image is to look at each pixel in the image. It&rsquo;s pretty straightforward; anyone who understands that images are made of pixels could write a simple algorithm to do it.</p>

<p>You can improve on that basic method a little bit but there are no incredible gains to be had with an iterative method.</p>

<p>Generalized, the problem is essentially how to find the location of some two dimensional submatrix within a larger matrix. It sounds like a problem with a clever mathematical solution and it, in fact, is.</p>

<p>The Fast Fourier Transform is usually used in digital signal processing (i.e. one dimension) to decompose a signal into its constiuent parts. Interestingly, performing discrete FFTs on images (i.e. two dimensions) is a process known as convolution where (roughly) the two images are superimposed on eachother at every point. You can use this method to find parts of a large image that are similar to a smaller image.</p>

<p>None of this is new research. The fast fourier transform is a common and useful function that is used in image processing. It also has the added benefit that it can be significantly sped up with specialized vector instructions on CPUs and GPUs.</p>

<p>There are a number of packages that exist for doing image processing via FFT on different platforms but none that take advantage of the accelerated vector libraries that exist on all recent Mac and iOS devices and that are easy for anyone with a passing knowledge of Objective-C to use. That&rsquo;s what I set out to do.</p>

<p><strong>Feature Detection exposes an easy interface for Objective-C developers to identify features in images.</strong> The more technical details are on <a href="http://github.com/nickoneill/LAFeatureDetection">the github project</a>if you&rsquo;re interested, as well as some example images.</p>

		<p>I love the philosophies behind Industry City Distillery, shown in <a href="http://vimeo.com/42991839">this very well produced video</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing that grabs me is the attention to detail in each of the processes shown. Not only are they paying incredible attention to the science of distilling but the labeling is done on an old letterpress which gives it that extra ounce of style.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thecityfoundry.com/">The City Foundry</a>, the larger organization around the distillery, has similarly awesome goals. It&rsquo;s easy to say that manufacturing is entirely dead in the water but TCF is based on the idea that it simply needs to evolve into a product that fits the future.</p>

<p>Their todo list is equally ambitious:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Secure and outfit a 6000 SQFT manufacturing facility</li>
<li>Create a highly advanced distillation process</li>
<li>Develop a small alcohol fueled turbine engine</li>
<li>Find and purchase a derelict power station</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I love it, there are so many great ideas here.</p>
