<p>Laser cutting and 3D printing were not quite up to the task (cost, materials, etc) so he milled his own in wax using a drill press on a moving stage and then cast it in resin. Old school methods but absolutely awesome results. You must see it to believe it.</p>

		<p>This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mcuIc5O-DE&amp;feature=player_embedded">animated TED talk</a> is actually about how pain <em>relievers</em> work but it explains the basis of pain as well, including some curious details that I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>George Zaidan (creator of the lesson, not the animator) finds a way to explain some fairly complicated biology without resorting to useless over simplications (it works by &ldquo;blocking pain&rdquo;!). I&rsquo;ll have to flip through more educational videos on <a href="http://ed.ted.com/">TED-ed</a>.</p>

			Feature Detection With Objective-C</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>(I&rsquo;m at WWDC this week, I figure I should probably release something of my own)</em></p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t being completely modest when I recently <a href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/line-simplification.html">praised line simplification</a> for bringing a method to the masses. It&rsquo;s not a great example though, so let me explain in a little more detail.</p>

<p>For any large group of people interacting with a technology, the vast majority are using it as a means to an end. I say this in a positive way. In fact, one sign of a truly successful technology is when people can ignore the amazing technical steps that enable them to do things they couldn&rsquo;t otherwise do.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of technical chops. I don&rsquo;t know how to write my own touchscreen driver but I can make apps that run on an iPhone because of the abstraction given to me by Apple.</p>

<p>Apple happens to be particularly good at technical complexity abstraction but open source projects are my favorite examples of technical movement because they&rsquo;re not driven by an obvious monitary incentive (I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s an argument that OS is driven by ego, but let&rsquo;s move on).</p>

<p>Before javascript frameworks, a limited number of people were using (and hating) straight javascript for everything. jQuery may have not been the first framework but it was the most effective at abstracting the hard/dumb parts of javascript away so that it was less intimidating to write.</p>

<p>Considering that javascript is already one of the easiest languages to get started with (everybody already has an interpreter!), it&rsquo;s not much of a stretch to suggest that jQuery made more programmers.</p>

<p>Arduino has done the same thing for microcontrollers. I spent some time on microcontroller projects just before arduino hardware started gaining popularity and the technical challenges at the time were huge. It was incredibly difficult to get started without having a pool of knowledge across multiple domains.</p>

<p>Arduino gave people a device that didn&rsquo;t require testing and soldering before they were writing code and making things blink.</p>

<p>I think Arduino is still stronger on the hardware side than software (there are so many tiny rules in C one must knowâ€¦), but the adoption is amazing. It was difficult to turn around without smacking your head on an Arduino at Maker Faire this year.</p>

<p>The fascinating thing about these projects is that they didn&rsquo;t necessarily invent anything new. Touchscreens existed before the iPhone (though Apple made them suck less) but it wraped the experience in an intuitive way. Everyone wrote their own javascript framework for projects before jQuery, but they packaged it together and made it fast. Arduino just made hardware that had the exact functionality that hobbyists wanted.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a particular fan of one subgenre: Projects that take complex methods that exist in academic research and making them available in a familiar format. That brings me to my own project that I&rsquo;ve been working on for a while: <a href="http://github.com/nickoneill/LAFeatureDetection">Feature Detection</a>, which finds features in images programmatically.</p>

<p>The most obvious computational method of finding a feature in an image is to look at each pixel in the image. It&rsquo;s pretty straightforward; anyone who understands that images are made of pixels could write a simple algorithm to do it.</p>

<p>You can improve on that basic method a little bit but there are no incredible gains to be had with an iterative method.</p>

<p>Generalized, the problem is essentially how to find the location of some two dimensional submatrix within a larger matrix. It sounds like a problem with a clever mathematical solution and it, in fact, is.</p>

<p>The Fast Fourier Transform is usually used in digital signal processing (i.e. one dimension) to decompose a signal into its constiuent parts. Interestingly, performing discrete FFTs on images (i.e. two dimensions) is a process known as convolution where (roughly) the two images are superimposed on eachother at every point. You can use this method to find parts of a large image that are similar to a smaller image.</p>

<p>None of this is new research. The fast fourier transform is a common and useful function that is used in image processing. It also has the added benefit that it can be significantly sped up with specialized vector instructions on CPUs and GPUs.</p>

<p>There are a number of packages that exist for doing image processing via FFT on different platforms but none that take advantage of the accelerated vector libraries that exist on all recent Mac and iOS devices and that are easy for anyone with a passing knowledge of Objective-C to use. That&rsquo;s what I set out to do.</p>

<p><strong>Feature Detection exposes an easy interface for Objective-C developers to identify features in images.</strong> The more technical details are on <a href="http://github.com/nickoneill/LAFeatureDetection">the github project</a>if you&rsquo;re interested, as well as some example images.</p>

		<p>I love the philosophies behind Industry City Distillery, shown in <a href="http://vimeo.com/42991839">this very well produced video</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing that grabs me is the attention to detail in each of the processes shown. Not only are they paying incredible attention to the science of distilling but the labeling is done on an old letterpress which gives it that extra ounce of style.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thecityfoundry.com/">The City Foundry</a>, the larger organization around the distillery, has similarly awesome goals. It&rsquo;s easy to say that manufacturing is entirely dead in the water but TCF is based on the idea that it simply needs to evolve into a product that fits the future.</p>

<p>Their todo list is equally ambitious:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Secure and outfit a 6000 SQFT manufacturing facility</li>
<li>Create a highly advanced distillation process</li>
<li>Develop a small alcohol fueled turbine engine</li>
<li>Find and purchase a derelict power station</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I love it, there are so many great ideas here.</p>

		<p><a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/simplify/">This post</a> about line simplification may seem esoteric but it&rsquo;s work like this, displayed and understood simply, that pushes technology forward. It&rsquo;s not new research but it&rsquo;s applied in a way that fits exactly the use case that a niche needs.</p>

<p>All it takes is an idea of how to do something better, or faster or more clearly. Suddenly there are three libraries in every language that do it and everyone gets a better experience.</p>

<p>Also, I love the idea of blogpost note margins so much that I may steal it.</p>

		<p>Possibly my favorite part of this <a href="http://kottke.org/12/04/slow-motion-stupidity">montage of dumb things filmed with a high speed camera</a> is the physics.</p>

<p>At 2500fps it gets really obvious that gravity and air resistance play a major role in slowing down fast moving things. Even small pieces of watermelon that are ejected by fireworks get noticeably slower right after the explosion. I won&rsquo;t bother with the kinematics, I&rsquo;m sure you get all the video analysis you need from <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/dotphysics/">Dot Physics</a>.</p>

<p>I noticed two really fast things in this video, one of which is obvious and the other not so much. Can you guess what they are?</p>
