		<p>There was a lot of talk when TBBT first started playing about the accuracy of the science on the show, whiteboards included. Now you can read an interview with the Science Advisor to the show, David Saltzberg.</p>

<p>It&apos;s interesting both for how current physics developments make it onto the show
and for the general behind-the-scenes look at a sitcom in contrast to how it feels on TV.</p>

<p>The best part about this is that it&apos;s really not super expensive. Quadcopter kits are easily under $500 (less if you already have some of the electronics) and small HD cameras like the Go Pro are ~$300, so you can shoot awesome aerial footage for significantly less than $1000. There are plenty of more expensive hobbies.</p>

		<p>Jesse Thorn (I think I&apos;ve mentioned <a href="http://putthison.com/">Put This On</a> before but he can adequately be described as a public radio nerd regardless of if you&apos;ve heard him before) write about <em>things</em> &ndash; methods, outlooks, etc &ndash; that you should do to Make Your Thing. They&apos;re all great notes about specific people who are successful at doing what they care about.</p>

<p>Being Jesse Thorn must be really fascinating. He&apos;s one of these people that is involved random projects from all over. Every time I find a new interesting internet show or podcast there&apos;s a good 50/50 chance that Jesse has had a hand in it. He&apos;s also had a radio show since he was 19 &ndash; the same one, albeit with a slightly different name or content &ndash; and that takes some enviable dedication to have done something for eleven years straight. I wonder what kind of inspiration he had growing up to develop such awesome habits.</p>

			Why Do Some People Learn Faster?</a>
	</h2>

		<p>An oldie but goodie about Failure-Learning loops.</p>

<p>The critical part of this article (and why it feels more concrete than other social science based discussions on learning) is the identification of error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) activity in the brain. Researchers can actually tell if you&apos;re making mistakes and simply giving up or making an effort to learn from your mistake.</p>

<p>My favorite part from the article:
&gt; After the children finished the test, the researchers told the students their score, and provided them with a single line of praise. Half of the kids were praised for their intelligence. “You must be smart at this,” the researcher said. The other students were praised for their effort: “You must have worked really hard.”</p>

<p>After this, the kids were offered a second test with the choice of harder or easier questions:
&gt; When kids were praised for their effort, nearly 90 percent chose the harder set of puzzles. However, when kids were praised for their intelligence, most of them went for the easier test.</p>

<p>So not only can we tell if someone isn&apos;t making mistakes positively, we can influence their learning so that they make better choices and learn from their mistakes in the future!</p>

<p>It fits nicely with my own personal theory: there are no <em>smart</em> people or <em>dumb</em> people, there are people who choose to do smart things and people who choose to do dumb things.</p>

			This Is How I Blog</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h3>This is out of date, I don&rsquo;t use this tool anymore. I want to build something similar on a more robust platform but for now I&rsquo;m just back to Octopress</h3>

<p>Pinboard is my blog platform. Or at least it was for most of 2011. I let my science blog Fine Structure wane at the start of last year when I stopped having time to research and write long posts about science topics. It was incredibly enlightening to dig deep into a complex topic it but it&rsquo;s not easy.</p>

<p>I still wanted to keep the blog alive even if I was just posting some short links and summaries because I was still reading a plethora of science blogs. I found that wrapping up complex topics in a few sentences is a great way to solidify my understanding of whatever I was reading as well.</p>

<p>Eventually I started Pinboarding links I wanted to write about in an attempt to pick up the habit but I resisted pasting my Pinboard descriptions in the Movable Type interface out of laziness (or intimidation).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like a technical challenge to motivate though so I glued together something from existing plugins to grab pinboard links with certain tags and generate posts on Fine Structure. Yes, I put in a bunch of effort upfront in an attempt to reduce the amount of effort I needed to post daily. It sounds contrary.</p>

<p>But the result was great. I felt liberated by the tiny non-wysiwyg text box of Pinboard and the lazy publishing model. I would write a few sentences about a link, add a tag and save it. Sometime in the next 30 minutes it would be posted to Fine Structure and it would float by on twitter.</p>

<p>I was pretty happy with that amount of effort for Fine Structure so I didn&rsquo;t think more about it.</p>

<p>A little later I started writing some posts on topics that weren&rsquo;t science related so I resurrected a personal blog (here! that&rsquo;s this!). I still felt sick of web writing interfaces so I wrote a little static site generator in python. It took a bunch of text files and made a blog. Easy enough, right?</p>

<p>I still wasn&rsquo;t happy though. I fussed with <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> a bit which I felt was a great flexible tool to publish a blog &ndash; a (much much) more polished version of the thing I had written previously.</p>

<p>The thing was… I still had to generate my blog on one computer. Even if I had synced my templates and posts and octopres on every computer I own, I still had to do some work between <em>writing</em> and being <em>done</em>. It was still a pain.</p>

<p>I spoke to <a href="http://alexba.in">Alex</a> about it over chat one day. I recall saying &ldquo;what I really want is cloud Octopress, but who has the time to build such a thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As it turns out, I did.</p>

<p>The answer was rooted in Dropbox. I wanted to write stuff and put it on Dropbox from anywhere &ndash; what device <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> have a Dropbox client? &ndash; and then just have a computer somewhere else do the octopressing for me. Don&rsquo;t make me configure a post, just let me write, save and publish.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d been using <a href="http://www.golang.org">Go</a> on a few small projects and I was really getting into the groove of prototyping things quickly. I figured it&rsquo;d be a good exercise so I started writing a <a href="https://github.com/nickoneill/go-dropbox">Dropbox API wrapper</a>. Once that was done, a few more lines had me generating a site from files in my Dropbox.</p>

<p>As it stands, <a href="https://github.com/nickoneill/go-publisher">go-publisher</a> looks at files in Dropbox every 20 minutes or so and generates a site if something has changed. Posts are easy to write, just Markdown and some YAML front matter (ala <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/yaml-front-matter">Jekyll</a>), most of which is generated for you. Minimally, you can just write until you&rsquo;re done and add <code>---published: true---</code> to the top of your post. Everything else is just done.</p>

<p>Back to Pinboard. I loved my Fine Structure posting method so much that I wanted to retain it in this new thing I was building so I wrote a quick addition that makes documents in Dropbox from Pinboard posts (modularity!). This is still my favorite way to keep on top of my blog on a daily basis.</p>

<p>There are a few other projects that I didn&rsquo;t know about at the time, including <a href="http://calepin.co/">Calepin</a> and <a href="http://scriptogr.am/">scriptogr.am</a> which <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil">Anil</a> tipped me off to. They feel very similar in goals, probably great if you want a simple blog and don&rsquo;t care to run it yourself. I didn&rsquo;t honestly expect to be the only one with this idea. In fact, it feels nice to have my needs reflected by others.</p>

<p>So it <a href="https://github.com/nickoneill/go-publisher">exists on github</a> now. It&rsquo;s actively used (by me) and I update it whenever I run into something that makes blogging not fun (or, y&#8217;know, bugs). It needs a name as well. Something clever. If this is the sort of thing that interests you, you should fork it. Learning Go is fairly enjoyable as well but that&rsquo;s another blog post.</p>

<p>I wrote a few core foundations for my motivation in the readme:</p>

<blockquote><p>• you already write long form with your favorite tools<br />
• you already have streams of short form stuff<br />
• you don&rsquo;t want to be constrained to a single computer/device<br />
• you don&rsquo;t want to babysit a publishing platform</p></blockquote>

<p>Make these tools get out of my way so I can Just Fucking Write. Let&rsquo;s make it a trend.</p>
