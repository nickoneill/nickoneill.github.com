<p>Two of my favorite subreddits are Ask Science and Explain Like I&rsquo;m Five because of the frequent awesome answers from people who actually know what they&rsquo;re talking about (on the internet! I know!).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been hearing more hubbub about Obamacare recently but don&rsquo;t really know how the changes to insurance will effect you, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/tb/vbkfm">this is a great summary</a> from someone answering a question on Explain Like I&rsquo;m 5. It&rsquo;s definitely biased towards the legislation being a positive change but it also doesn&rsquo;t hide the potentially negative points. Make your own opinion!</p>
