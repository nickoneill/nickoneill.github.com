<p>Here&apos;s a video of Chris Anderson&apos;s (yes, the WIRED editor) TED Ed talk on questions that no one knows the answer to. The talk consistently touches on curiosity which is conveniently one of my favorite topics.</p>

<p>Even though it deals primarily with unanswered physics questions, I post it here instead of <a href="http://finestructure.com/">Fine Structure</a> because it&apos;s a basic view of unanswered questions. Scientists have a ton of competing opinions about the details on these unanswered questions &ndash; it&apos;s not like no one is trying to answer them &ndash; and it&apos;s more useful to know that the questions exist in the first place.</p>
