	<h2 class="title">Free Startup Idea Tuesday</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">So, back when news traveled around that Delicious was being killed off by Yahoo, andre torrez had this great idea to come up with a list of todo items that one would have to do [to clone Delicious](http://notes.torrez.org/2010/12/learn-to-program-in-24-hours.html). I'm not sure if anything ever came from it, but I like the idea of disconnected brainstorming - andre did some thinking about what you'd need but he doesn't want to do the engineering related work for it so he's put his ideas out there in case there's someone who has more time or interest.

Startup-y types like to keep their ideas close to their chest because everyone is so fearful of **stealcloning** (yes, I made that word up right now). Here's how it purportedly works: a big company gets wind of your idea, thinks the whole thing is a brilliant piece of synergistic, user-centric *blah blah blah marketingspeak* and decides to clone it outright. They take a team of 10 people, evenly spit between engineers, marketing and sales people that were just sitting on their asses and twiddling their thumbs before this very moment and put them to work on **stealcloning** your idea. Despite the fact that this project has been blindly handed down from above with little thought into how it fits into the overall company strategy, the team members are overjoyed to work on the project, put in many hours of overtime and care about it like it's their very own flesh and blood. The big company releases the product two weeks later to critical acclaim and without any bugs. Your project, on the other hand, is left in the dust.

You can see the fallacies here, right? Allow me to show you the venn diagram of what I'm talking about:

![Yes, there is a very small overlap](/images/venn.png)

I'm not saying that no one can clone your ideas, but it's probably not the threat you're treating it as.

Back to the idea of making a Delicious clone. What strikes me about the current business-of-the-month idea, Groupon clones in this case, is that no one feels the need to innovate and improve on Groupon's model. Living Social is a *straightup* clone of their features (a me-too clone, not a **stealclone**). Groupon does have its flaws though and there are lots of interesting ways to extend the idea of business-customer interaction. Here's one:

Groupon holds businesses by the balls in so many ways. Customers purchase a deal for the business but the businesses don't get any idea of who their customers are, they just get a list of coupon codes that were purchased. Furthermore, since Groupon holds one deal per day for a given area, businesses are at the whim of Groupon as to when the deal goes down. I've heard that Groupon gives as little as 24 hours notice to a business before its deal goes live.

Here's a plan: keep the group-buying, loose to tight control and gain a bunch of customer data. Businesses get their own page on the site (let's pretend it's called **deal.me**) at nickscoffee.deal.me where customers can sign up for notifications from that very business. The page is like an about.me for business to customer marketing, nice looking big photos and a bit of text about the business. When the business wants to have a deal for customers, it's listed prominently there along with the standard Groupon sharing links, timer and deal stats.

Customers already have an account on deal.me so they don't have to signup for anything new, or even input credit card data. They might get a micro bonus deal for signing up to be notified of deals from this particular business ($5 off coupon, say) through their email, text message and/or iPhone app notifications. They can explore businesses by location and category and sign up to hear about deals from the stuff they're interested in.

After your first deal goes down, the business has a nice big page of statistics on who purchased their deal. Users are sorted by age, gender, amount of deals purchased, or any other statistic that you can get. Users are incentivized to give this data because businesses can send post-deal coupons to customer segments which is pushed directly to users phones by text or notification. Slow afternoon at the hair salon? Send a $10 coupon out to a demographic that's likely to be free at that time. Once you have an instant connection to your customer base, deals can be shorter and more specific so you can drive customers when you want them.

Or send a coupon to all users who have a connected foursquare account but haven't checked in in the last month. Or thank those who have lots of checkins. It's giving the customers back to the business, not keeping them inside Groupon where they lease some web site space out to you every once in a while.

So that's the idea. It would be fun to develop as a product but it would require some technical skills that I don't have, not to mention some sales skills that I definitely don't have. It's just an idea and now it is free to be executed on by anyone that has the time and desire to do so.</div>
