<p>I like it when people take old things and move them into the future in such a way that it compliments both the classic feel and the new technology. Such is the case with Playfic.</p>

<p>First thing: Waxy.org has an intern. Andy Baio hired his nephew to do some work and the two of them ended up with a way to play interactive fiction on the internet. That&apos;s not too original, but they added ways to remix the stories or easily create something new from scratch. Plus Twitter&apos;s Bootstrap, so of course it looks great. It really compliments interactive fiction and the technology just gets out of the way.</p>
