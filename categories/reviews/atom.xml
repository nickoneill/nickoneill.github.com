    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637688/">In Time</a> turned out to be a movie that relied far too heavily on making time puns. As for the plot, there are about a million ways one can make an interesting scifi storyline with immortality <em>and</em> time-as-currency but the writer/director managed to keep everything pretty shallow.</p>

<p>Speaking of, writing <em>and</em> directing a film seems like a Lucas-esque control freak move. You&rsquo;re the best writer you could convince to do your movie? Unlikely. And the best director? These odds are not getting better. Don&rsquo;t even get me started on people who write/direct/star.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of Matt Bomer on <em>White Collar</em> so I was disappointed by his lack of screen time. He may have been the only character in the entire film with clear motivations, though that may have been simply a side effect of being a chracter who dies early.</p>

<p>In conclusion, do not watch.</p>
