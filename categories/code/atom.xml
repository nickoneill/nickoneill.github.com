    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> (well, quicksilver then launchbar now alfred) for launching apps and doing small calculations but I was reluctant to use it for other tasks for some reason. Slowly I started replacing some common tasks with Alfred actions, first finding albums to play on iTunes and then making <a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a> entries on the fly.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t pick up new alfred workflows too often because they can be very dependent on your own personal workflow; a lot of other people&rsquo;s workflows don&rsquo;t really fit with how I work. Plus lots of other apps have keyboard shortcuts of their own. Alfred is great for tasks where you can quickly navigate a few lists to find an item or forward some text input to another app quickly &ndash; usually chrome for searches.</p>

<p>So I was surprised when I found <a href="https://github.com/zenorocha/alfred-workflows">a few programming workflows</a> that  fit nicely into my routine. I picked up the package manager (I always open a new terminal window to install from brew or npm), the color converter (constantly converting between these formats for web work), and github (navigating a shallow set of lists!) and stackoverflow search.</p>
