    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re in San Francisco you may have received some interesting fear-based advertising today. Your first indication that something is wrong may be the bait-and-switch. The front of the mailer says:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>RISING COST OF LIVING</strong><br/><strong>ESCALATING RENTS</strong><br/><strong>IMPENDING EVICTIONS</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>This may confuse you as the rest of the mailer is urging you to vote against beverage taxes.</p>

<p>But that’s not really the point. Special interests use the bait-and-switch all the time and it’s <em>such</em> an easy tactic to notice that I might even count this as a point for proponents of the tax. Nobody likes to be lied to and to make it so obvious is just… sad.</p>

<p>The fine print is where the best lies are though. For starters you should consider who paid for the advertising. The return address just say “Coalition for an Affordable City” but in slightly smaller text below, it turns out this mailer was paid for specifically by the American Beverage Association &ndash; a member of CFAAC. The ABA is of course championed by the usual suspects at <em>Dr Pepper Snapple Group</em> and <em>Pepsi-Cola North America</em>, etc. I’m sure you can come up with the rest of the members list off the top of your head.</p>

<p>That’s not a lie in itself, of course, but one should always know if the people paying for your advertisements are the same people who you pay for various goods and services.</p>

<h2>the end notes</h2>

<p>Let’s look at more small text now! There sure are a lot of end notes for a tiny mailer. And looking closely… it seems that half the notes are just links to articles about how expensive it is to live in SF. Fascinating, but not terribly relevant (I realize there are people in this city for whom an increase in beverage price is a <em>big deal</em>, my issue is that they present this as half their argument and then distribute their fliers in Noe Valley where it is most definitely <em>not</em> a big deal). There’s just as much fear-based marketing in the little text at the bottom of the page as there is in the BIG BOLD TEXT at the top.</p>

<p>To be fair, the last three end notes are actually about soda taxes.</p>

<p>The first, a New York Times “<a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/30/do-fat-taxes-work/">article</a>” &ndash; I say this because it’s a whopping 430 words long, a significant portion of which is quoting or summarizing another article &ndash; which says “Yes, this will raise some extra tax money” and also “Here’s a scholarly article on soda taxes”. The article is from 2009 and I’m completely sure that in the last five years there has been no interest or notable legislation for soda taxes in New York state that would compel the NYT to write about the subject in any form (in five minutes, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/03/nyregion/03sodatax.html">nope</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/world/americas/mexico-takes-a-bloomberg-like-swing-at-obesity.html">nope</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/17/nyregion/de-blasio-names-ex-bloomberg-official-as-health-chief-but-vows-new-approach.html">nope</a>).</p>

<p>Back to the linked article: that article says… Actually, let’s hold out on that for just a moment&hellip;</p>

<p>…Because the next end note is said <a href="http://www.atg.state.vt.us/assets/files/Powell%20et%20al%20-%20Food%20Prices%20and%20Obesity-Evidence%20and%20Policy%20Implications%20for%20Taxes%20and%20Subsidies%20-%20Milbank%202009.pdf">quoted article</a> from the previous note. The article is a summary of other studies of obesity rates and prices and does, in fact, say what the mailer wants it to say:</p>

<blockquote><p>…small taxes or subsidies were not likely to produce significant changes in BMI or obesity prevalence…</p></blockquote>

<p>And in practically the same breath this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Even though they would only have a small impact on individual behavior, such interventions could have a large impact at the population level when applied broadly.</p></blockquote>

<p>And this:</p>

<blockquote><p>As proxies by the prices of energy-dense fast foods and sugar, adolescents’ and adults’ weight was found to be price sensitive.</p></blockquote>

<p>The article goes on to state that soda is in a very similar state to cigarettes before the grand tax increases of the last 30 years which has been credited with significant declines in smoking. Mostly it just says “here are some studies, they’re not really great overall but here are some conclusions we can make. And here are a bunch of ways we could make the studies better in the future.”</p>

<p>The last end note is part of the California Constitution that states, in somewhat cryptic legalese:</p>

<blockquote><p>Neither the State of California nor any of its political subdivisions shall levy or collect a sales or use tax on the sale of, or the storage, use or other consumption in this State of food products for human consumption except as provided by statute as of the effective date of this section.</p></blockquote>

<p>And which the mailer describes as “added by California voters in 1992 to prevent snack taxes”. Note the language that California uses because it cares specifically about snacks and soda. Also are drinks food? But we have an alcohol tax? As always, the laws are so clear in California.</p>

<p>I almost forgot to mention the implication that “we legislated against this in 1992 so let’s never reconsider our position ever again” because it’s not like California ever outlawed anything with a proposition that may have been wrong.</p>

<h2>final snark</h2>

<p>The point is <em>not</em> that you should vote <strong>for</strong> or <strong>against</strong> a soda tax. The point is that you should take a moment and look at the mailer that you agree or disagree with and find out how the sponsors are manipulating you (and they are). Then you may discard it, or call it justified and move on with your life.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I head ever closer to 30 this year I&rsquo;m looking for any excuse to beleive that your 20s are <em>not</em> the most creative or productive time in a person&rsquo;s life. Now I&rsquo;m hearing that the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/big-breakthroughs-come-in-your-late-30s/283858/">average Nobel Prize age is well into the late 30s</a> and pushing later for non-abstract fields. Though I&rsquo;m not currently trying for a Nobel Prize, it&rsquo;s a positive note.</p>

<p>But everyone has always said that younger people have quantifiably better responses on cognitive function tests! Turns out this measurement may not the whole picture, there are interesting new results that suggest <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/statistical-life/201401/the-myth-age-related-cognitive-decline">measuring on speed alone is a poor indicator of a good answer</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, you young people may be answering your questions faster but we&rsquo;re answering them <em>better</em>. Get off my lawn.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/homebrewing/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-06T12:58:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nickoneill.name/homebrewing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I mentioned beer, specifically the <a href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/beer-recipes-white-house/">White House Honey Porter recipe</a> (currently in bottles! Very tasty!), but if you&rsquo;ve seen me in person in the last year we&rsquo;ve probably talked about it &ndash; assuming you like beer.</p>

<p><a style="float:left;margin-right:20px;" href="http://makefi.gs/f/TLD7K"><img src="http://makefi.gs/g/TLD7K" alt="fermentation" /></a> I&rsquo;ve made 4 or 5 beers over the last year and the process is starting to become second nature. I&rsquo;m still not completely confident in my ability to tweak recipes or make them up from scratch but I&rsquo;m experimenting with the process to figure out how I can make existing recipes taste like quality beer rather than half-assed homebrew.</p>

<p>I ascribe the fact that I haven&rsquo;t made any really terrible beers to Rebecca&rsquo;s experience with sane sterilization methods from her biology background. It all seems pretty logical now but I made quite a few mistakes in sterilization the first few times we brewed together.</p>

<p>If we&rsquo;ve talked about beer recently than you&rsquo;ve probably heard me say that homebrewing lacks reproducability. The most complex homebrew setups might have temperature on first and second fermentation but the process of moving between vessels and time spent in each vessel is still manual. Even though I&rsquo;m new enough where I don&rsquo;t even know if these things make a difference (though the literature talks about avoiding excess oxidation &ndash; a transfer issue), it feels like too much variability to be able to reproduce a beer recipe that you really like.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I like the idea of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cargo/brewbot-the-smart-brewing-appliance">brewbot</a>. Details are a little fuzzy on the kickstarter site but it&rsquo;s essentially an arduino controlled brewing setup where multiple brewing steps are automated for you (ignore the part where it says &ldquo;brewing… with an iPhone&rdquo;, as far as I can tell the iPhone is just a way to monitor its status). Hidden away like it is, it almost feels like it takes automation too far where a machine just brews generic beer for you constantly without your input.</p>

<p>To some degree, homebrewing is about the different tastes that multiple brewers can get from the same recipe. Not all different tastes are bad tastes after all &ndash; take the case of Brett yeasts that are typically considered bad bugs to have in your beer, some fancy microbrews have been using Brett to achive a very particular taste that&rsquo;s really good.</p>

<p>The truth of the brewbot is that you still have to decide on a recipe and clean everything and put the system together so there&rsquo;s work involved and choices to be made and that would still make brewbot brews unique.</p>

<p>Still, if I could brew 5 gallons of beer every two weeks (and I could, with an automated system like brewbot) I would have more beer than I could drink. A lot more.</p>

<p>I would really like to brew, say, 12 bottles of a different recipe every two weeks and see how each tweak changes the beer before gearing up to a 5 or 15 gallon batch. However, as I&rsquo;ve been reminded by my personal biologist, these biological processes do not scale linearly and taste will vary if you&rsquo;re using the same parameters for small and large batches.</p>

<p>It would be a good start for larger batches though. And less floor space than a brewbot machine which seems oversized for a regular kitchen from the photos. There&rsquo;s always room for another kickstarter though, right?</p>

    <link href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/handy-alfred-workflows/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-26T10:34:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nickoneill.name/handy-alfred-workflows</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> (well, quicksilver then launchbar now alfred) for launching apps and doing small calculations but I was reluctant to use it for other tasks for some reason. Slowly I started replacing some common tasks with Alfred actions, first finding albums to play on iTunes and then making <a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a> entries on the fly.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t pick up new alfred workflows too often because they can be very dependent on your own personal workflow; a lot of other people&rsquo;s workflows don&rsquo;t really fit with how I work. Plus lots of other apps have keyboard shortcuts of their own. Alfred is great for tasks where you can quickly navigate a few lists to find an item or forward some text input to another app quickly &ndash; usually chrome for searches.</p>

<p>So I was surprised when I found <a href="https://github.com/zenorocha/alfred-workflows">a few programming workflows</a> that  fit nicely into my routine. I picked up the package manager (I always open a new terminal window to install from brew or npm), the color converter (constantly converting between these formats for web work), and github (navigating a shallow set of lists!) and stackoverflow search.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/bring-your-old-posts-to-the-reboot/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-16T12:04:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nickoneill.name/bring-your-old-posts-to-the-reboot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love this footnote from <a href="http://scribbling.net/2013/09/11/reboot/">Gina&rsquo;s blog reboot</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Several years ago, I took Scribbling.net&rsquo;s original archives down because they no longer represented me, and looking back at them embarrassed me, the way reading your diary from when you were a teenager would. Over time I hope to port selected essays back to the site for posterity.</p></blockquote>

<p>This rings particularly true for me, as I have archives from various blogs dating back to 2000 when I <em>was</em> actually a teenager.</p>

<p>Most of that content is embarassing personal stuff, I&rsquo;m still amazed that I chose to put it online but relieved by the fact that no one but me really read that stuff in the first place. Unlike <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/1999/07/">some people</a>, we can&rsquo;t all be perfectly happy with things we wrote 10+ years ago.</p>

<p>There are a few gems, however. Mostly stuff about my thoughts when I first moved out to San Francisco that I&rsquo;d like to hold on to (not that I couldn&rsquo;t hold on to it privately), but also some tech stuff I wrote about back then.</p>

<p>I like the idea of bringing selected posts back but doing it directly would probably be weird; a bunch of posts dating back to 2011 and then a smattering from 2004-5? Instead, I&rsquo;ll try to bring back the tech-related ones first with some thoughts on their context and what we&rsquo;ve seen since then.</p>

<p>The more personal ones might take longer to form a commentary on but if a blog is supposed to tell the story of who we are, it&rsquo;s probably relevant to look back on a few important moments over the last ten years or so.</p>

<blockquote><p>Researchers studying insects from sub-fossilized fragments of copal, an amber-like resin, extracted remains of stingless bees trapped around 10,000 years ago and attempted to analyze DNA fragments found within.

    <link href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/url-config-schemes/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-15T10:43:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nickoneill.name/url-config-schemes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just read about a neat feature for <a href="http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/experimental/">Letterpress 1.4 where savvy users can test Spanish games</a> by loading &ldquo;letterpress:experimental&rdquo; in Safari and I wanted to share an alternate example that I build for a client a while back.</p>

<p>In this particular case, the client wanted to distribute a single app binary via enterprise distribution or ad-hoc builds to various clients of his own. The catch was that all these clients wanted the app to look customized to their own brand with logos and colors.</p>

<p>Not only was I opposed to building a system where I would have to build multiple versions of the same app for multiple clients, I was pretty sure that anyone maintaining that sort of system down the road would put in the extra effort to seek me out and chop off each finger that contributed to writing that code.</p>

<p>Instead, I developed a configuration framework that responded to a specially crafted URL scheme. The app was totally functional upon first install but a URL could be sent along in the install email which prompted users to tap on it from their iOS device.</p>

<p>The url scheme was passed along to the app which inferred the location of a JSON configuration file somewhere on the internet, downloaded it, parsed the file for logo urls, offsets and RGBA color components and redrew the app with these visual changes. The JSON document was stored on the local disk for easy parsing sans-connectivity on the next startup.</p>

<p>It required a bit of conversion to drawing customizable elements with drawRect rather than patterning images but the flexibility was worth it many times over.</p>

<p>For this purpose, an unsolicited plug: recreating complex photoshop-made effects in Quartz2D is pretty easy with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paintcode/id507897570?mt=12">PaintCode</a>. Don&rsquo;t let the price throw you off if visual customizability or small app size is important to you, it&rsquo;s an incredible tool.</p>

<p>Depending on your feeling towards these fairly insecure URL schemes, you could package a username and password within them and provide users an automated way of logging in to your app. The possibilities for configuration are nearly endless and mostly underutilized, it seems.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/ice-maker-repair/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-07T15:06:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nickoneill.name/ice-maker-repair</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve got one of these GE Profile refrigerators from a few years ago (this one was installed 8 years ago, I think, model PSS26MSRD) and the ice maker isn&rsquo;t making ice, there are a few simple steps you can go through to troubleshoot.</p>

<p>First, pull out the ice bin and eyeball the ice maker device behind it. See if the switch is turned on and the green light is lit. If it&rsquo;s blinking, that indicates &ldquo;ice stuck in tray&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll have to take it out and thaw the whole contraption out. It&rsquo;s not that hard: unplug the giant molex connector on the right side and use a small hex wrench to unscrew the obvious screw holding it to the left side of the freezer wall. Then you can firmly pull the device up and out until it pops free from the notches where it sits in the back.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s ice stuck in the device, or if it&rsquo;s just not filling properly, let it sit out for a few hours until it warms up. Depending on the humidity conditions in your freezer, something could have frosted over.</p>

<p>Check the swing arm on the bottom of the device. Despite the appearance as a bit of useless plastic, it has a magnet attached to an arm inside the main ice maker housing which allows the maker to tell if the arm is extended or pushed part ways in. Ice being make and pushed into the bucket depresses the swing arm when it falls and the arm returns to the extended position via a small spring mounted between it and the unit unless the ice maker is full. This spring has a habit of popping out of a tiny hole and not providing the force needed for the arm to return to &ldquo;make more ice&rdquo; position. Check that it pushes back at you if you depress it.</p>

<p>Hopefully one of these items you&rsquo;ve checked wasn&rsquo;t working because they&rsquo;re all easy fixes. Reassemble and add it back to the freezer, making sure that the water dispenser in the back of the freezer leads INTO the ice maker, not BELOW it. This would cause a mess. Make sure the thing is plugged in again, and the green light is back on.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re impatient about waiting for another ice cycle to start, depress the swing arm three times in a row. This should tell the ice maker to immediately dispense water and start a new cycle.</p>

<p>This information was only found in bits and pieces scattered around the corners of the internet so I join them together here for the betterment of refrigerator-using people everywhere. Go forth and make ice.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/wearable-technology/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-22T12:05:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nickoneill.name/wearable-technology</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s a common theme in scifi where humans have some personalized technology which only they can hear and interact with, transparent to those around them. I think we&rsquo;re near that point, I give it less than five years before something iPhone-like takes off in this space.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked these gadgets in scifi but I only reexamined their possibility the other day. I was driving with my partner (<em>we&rsquo;ve been together too long for me to say &ldquo;girlfriend&rdquo; but have no other incentives to get married so we live in a perpetual middle-ground with no word to describe it. Thanks culture</em>) up above the bay on a trip that I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with so I set up turn-by-turn on my phone.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have a phone mount in the car, nor do I think I need constant feedback that I am on the right route. I just want a handy aural reminder when I&rsquo;m getting close to a turn. To accomplish this I used my headset in just one ear so I could continue listening to the radio and interacting with my passenger. I thought it was a nice solution; I don&rsquo;t have to rely on anyone else for directions and I&rsquo;m not distracted by an extra screen.</p>

<p>The robot direction lady said something I found funny from an engineering perspective, something like repeating the direction I was supposed to go three times in the span of five words.</p>

<p>And I laughed. I laughed at a joke told to me by a computer that was completely disconnected to whatever was currently on NPR or anything that anyone else in the car could hear. Maybe it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine but it felt like scifi in that weird way that scifi does when you realize that <em>it&rsquo;s here</em>.</p>

<p>No matter if you like it or not, this is where technology is going. People already create their personal technology bubble when they start fussing with phones in what would otherwise be a social environment. Having your personal assistant in your ear is just a bit less obvious to your companions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure your first thought is that people interacting with their cell phones while other people are around is obnoxious &ndash; and it is &ndash; but we have a long way to go.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the next step? I think we&rsquo;re well on our way towards more unobtrusive personal interactions with our technology, be it with Google Glass or the new Apple wearable thing. I mean the next, <em>next</em> step.</p>

<p>Just as we already dislike loud-talking bluetooth set-wearers in public places (too easily confused with people who talk to themselves), we&rsquo;ll quickly tire of people with funny glasses saying &ldquo;Glass, take a picture&rdquo; and &ldquo;Glass, call my wife&rdquo;. Even Siri, despite its novelty and usefulness, is rarely used in public because <em>its embarrassing to talk to yourself</em>.</p>

<p>So if you want to bet on technology that will be snatched up by the Apples and Googles, buy companies working on sublingual communication. That is, companies who use various technology to turn unspoken speech into parseable words.</p>

<p>In the close future this will probably be in the form of detecting muscle movements in your neck and mouth. Think about forming all your sentences but not making any sound, or talking without opening your mouth. That may take some practice.</p>

<p>Until then, I will continue to laugh at my turn-by-turn directions, somewhat awkwardly now, and want a Glass headset even though it&rsquo;s not stylish and totally weird to talk to yourself.</p>

<p>And yes, I will probably want an Apple wearable thing &ndash; as long as it&rsquo;s not a watch. Ugh, who wants to wear a watch again?</p>

<p><strong>A thing</strong>: Andre has an interesting take on the other obvious sense, <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2013/02/if-you-see-the-computer-they-blew-it.html">the very sight of wearable technology</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t understand about modern house construction; despite modern computation and robotics, we still rely on humans to measure and cut things piece-by-piece in order to build a house.</p>

<p>Prefab has negative connotations for being used to create cookie cutter houses that have no individuality but it&rsquo;s a self-imposed  limitation, especially considering that planning is already computerized. I think we can do better.</p>

<p>Given a few laser measurements of a land plot, we could easily use these as a baseline for architect plans which are already computerized in most cases. Even manual transfer of this plan into discrete wall and floor segments would be acceptable, but I think computers could do it automatically too.</p>

<p>Send it off to the robotic construction warehouse. Two-by-fours are tested and cut to perfect sizes with millimeter precision. Holes are drilled, electrical and plumbing equipment is placed and everything is sealed up with sheetrock, ready to be set in place at the construction site with LEGO-like instruction manuals.</p>

<p>Sure, human intervention is still required in the building process. There are benefits to pouring concrete on-site for foundations and all the fabricated parts still have to be secured together and painted over.</p>

<p>I suspect this would shorten the time spent on a new house significantly. What percent of the building process is spent framing a house? From the outside it looks to be a large chunk &ndash; once a building is framed it seems like a takes much less time to finish it. And much of the rest of the process (painting, carpeting) doesn&rsquo;t benefit from a significant increase in precision fabrication.</p>

<p>Given the evidence of many house remodeling shows on HGTV (strong evidence if I&rsquo;ve ever seen it), I suspect quality would improve as well. Any pipes or wire that was fabricated at a warehouse could be well-tested beforehand, reducing the chance of electrical fires in walls or leaky pipes due to improper soldering.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve definitely taken small steps in this direction, you buy cabinets that are pre-made for the kitchen and windows are packaged for easy installation. But, as always, we fear the steps that remove humans from parts of the equation &ndash; particularly now that the term &ldquo;job killer&rdquo; is such a politically loaded term &ndash; even when they&rsquo;re added in other locations.</p>

<p>Like most new things though, jobs wouldn&rsquo;t disappear but rather transition. Humans are needed to program, maintain and inspect the work in the fabrication warehouse. Construction speed would benefit greatly from having these warehouses close by, so many small-to-medium warehouses all over the country would be more beneficial than large factories that then have to ship parts thousands of miles.</p>

<p>I give it 20 years until we see something like this take form. Not due to technical limitations, we could do all of this right now, but mostly human factors.</p>

<p>This is what I get for having so much construction in Noe Valley; everywhere I go I see humans cutting and nailing wood together and I have to think &ldquo;can&rsquo;t we improve this?&rdquo; In my opinion, we can.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/2012-books-review/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-31T12:43:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nickoneill.name/2012-books-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As promised in <a href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/return-of-blog-holidays-edition.html">my last post</a>, some books I&rsquo;ve made my way through (or not) this year:</p>

<p>I started with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">World War Z</a>, the quintessential worldwide zombie outbreak book. The book is told as a series of interviews with survivors around the world, discussing the war from an interesting combination of personal and professional points of view. I enjoyed the format but I doubt it&rsquo;ll survive to the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816711/">movie interpretation</a>. Highly suggested to read before the movie comes out next year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to get through later books in the Ender&rsquo;s Game series a few times after I binge-read a bunch of them a few years ago and this year was no exception with an attempt to get through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ANUQ0K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">Ender in Exile</a>. And again, I couldn&rsquo;t push myself through the religious nonsense and sophomoric whining that the series has come to display in every iteration. At any rate, the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1731141/">Ender&rsquo;s Game movie</a> is finally being made and although I have no idea how much plot they&rsquo;ll fit into the the movie, I do have some hope since an <a href="http://img2.timeinc.net//ew/i/2012/12/03/fl-enders-game_810x543.jpg">early photo</a> looked pretty good.</p>

<p>I picked through a few technical books as well. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0086I5MCO/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">Getting Started with Dwarf Fortress</a> was a huge help getting started. I spent some time in Amsterdam with Steffen Itterheim&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006CO7ZQ0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">Learn cocos2d Game Development</a> though the project I was learning it for didn&rsquo;t pan out.</p>

<p>One of the more fascinating technical books this year was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RI8ZSW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">The New Science of Strong Materials</a> which isn&rsquo;t exactly new but has a number of great atomic-level explainations for material properties.</p>

<p>I have not touched any of the books from the <a href="http://blog.humblebundle.com/post/33237485887/introducing-the-humble-ebook-bundle">Humble ebook Bundle</a> which is unfortunate. Maybe next year.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008TRU7SQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">Richard Rhodes&#8217; <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em></a> is an incredible view into the life of scientists during the lead up to the second world war. In no way is it only about the literal manufacturing of atomic bombs but rather a look at how the chemistry and physics community discussed and developed new results in the first half of the 20th century. I&rsquo;m barely through a third of the book since I picked it up in November because of frequent side trips to Wikipedia to look up technical details or just to remind myself which scientist did what (keeping track of them all would require a dedicated notepad).</p>

<p>I started Isaacson&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PC0S0K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">Einstein</a> biography before that but I couldn&rsquo;t get into it before my focus was stolen away by something else. I may go back and give it another chance given how much I&rsquo;ve enjoyed The Making of the Atomic Bomb with the knowledge that I&rsquo;ll have to slog through the early years before more interesting science comes up.</p>

<p>My last great ambition for reading this year was Nate Silver&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007V65R54/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">The Signal and the Noise</a> which did not happen at all. Perhaps I should have started it earlier with respect to the election.</p>

<p>Lastly, my reading device switched from my kindle to an iPad mini late this year. I treat most of my reading as research in that I don&rsquo;t restrict myself from wandering the internet in search of more detail on a particular topic that has come up during reading, so the iPad mini is an incredible tool for me. Previously I would read on the kindle but I would always keep an iPad or computer nearby. Now I can just carry one thing around. I won&rsquo;t give a full review because I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve read others already but as a reading device it&rsquo;s highly recommended.</p>

    <id>http://blog.nickoneill.name/return-of-blog</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good day, blog friends!</p>

<p>Not counting <a href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/muniverse-2.html">Muniverse</a> (and I don&rsquo;t, it was waiting to be published for a while), it has been quite a time since I last wrote a thing. Here&rsquo;s some stuff that doesn&rsquo;t warrant its own post:</p>

<p>Brad and I finally finished a remote garage door opener based on an Arduino and WiFly. See the incredible frustration documented on G+ <a href="https://plus.google.com/115863474911002159675/posts/2PSkLbtUJRB">here</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/115863474911002159675/posts/WCen2ZJE9vz">here</a>. A few more tweaks and the whole thing will be on github.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m doing some more frequent science tweeting with <a href="https://twitter.com/finestructure">@finestructure</a>. I never realized I felt a little trapped in my regular twitter account, I&rsquo;m not an oversharer and I don&rsquo;t like to innundate my friends with dumb stuff. Strangers, on the other hand, love dumb stuff. Seriously though, it&rsquo;s full of excellent science and snark.</p>

<p>I want to get back to blogging more on the proper Fine Structure blog but I&rsquo;m frustrated with my publishing setup there. I want to adapt <a href="https://github.com/nickoneill/go-publisher">my dropbox static publisher</a> for this purpose but it requires some thinking, generalizing and coding. Maybe during vacation, or after I write some content.</p>

<p>Work continues to be enjoyable. There are many ways to run a small contracting business and my current method involves doing enough directly billable work to be comfortable and then investing the rest of my time in learning new things &ndash; not always directly related to work. I don&rsquo;t think I could ever swing a deal like that at a standard salaried job so I think I&rsquo;ll be doing this for a while.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m spending a bit of time playing <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a> (as little time as someone can spend and still improve in the Most Complex Game Ever). I tend to leave it alone for a few weeks then see something that inspires me to start a new fort, play that for a few days and get totally destroyed by a seige of undead. Such is life in the DF. I would very much like to try a Let&rsquo;s Play video for DF so we&rsquo;ll see where that idea goes in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>I started writing about my current reading list here but it ran far too long, that will have to come at a later date. Welcome back, blog!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Muniverse 2]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/muniverse-20/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-17T09:43:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nickoneill.name/muniverse-20</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many years ago as I was learning Objective-C and Jamison was going through his public transit phase (yes, as far as I know he&rsquo;s still in it), we joined forces to create an epic San Francisco Muni app for the iPhone.</p>

<p>It was my first ground-up project for the iPhone so I found myself wanting to rewrite large swaths of the code every 2-3 weeks. For obvious reasons, I tried to keep the stuff that was ugly but effective and that got us to the release. Unfortunately it was little help for keeping things updated as any Muni route changes were a big pain to incorporate. Eventually new versions of iOS deprecated bits and pieces of APIs we were using and new APIs replaced them. After a while the app started crashing on startup and I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to debug (my) ancient newbie code.</p>

<p>The original Muniverse has since been removed from the app store for those reasons (interestingly, Apple doesn&rsquo;t seem to care if a previously approved app starts crashing on new iOS versions). However, I still stand by our goals for the project; find when your bus or train or street car arrives in the least amount of taps. We literally want you to be in the app for as little time as possible (but every day, of course).</p>

<p>Looking at other Muni apps since then, it&rsquo;s pretty sad to be a rider with an iPhone. Everyone has clunky methods for finding your stops (be they map-oriented or otherwise) and no one makes it as easy as Muniverse to get times for the stop you use every single day. Most of the apps are clearly built by people who don&rsquo;t live in San Francisco or who don&rsquo;t use Muni often enough to know the weird configuration for the KT or which stop names are wrong when they come out of the NextBus API.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why Jamison and I have rethought Muniverse from the ground up and are happy to report that an all new Muniverse is currently on the app store. For free.</p>

<p>Why rerelease Muniverse? We both feel that having a showpiece for our separate skills on the App Store is a great example to show potential clients. Jamison&rsquo;s UI/UX contributions are obvious when using the app, though the code is a bit more difficult to evaluate even if the app works as intended.</p>

<p>Rewriting everything gave me an opportunity to explore some of the modern Objective-C features that can make development easier and faster. Muniverse uses storyboards, core data, new literals and eventually will integrate with the new transit routing APIs. To better illustrate my side of the development process and provide a complete, modern reference for those who are learning Objective-C, <a href="https://github.com/nickoneill/Muniverse2">the entire codebase is on github</a>.</p>

<p>However, the open source license doesn&rsquo;t cover everything since we don&rsquo;t want anyone to re-release the very same code as their own. The graphics are included in the project but are not licensed for use. In addition, there&rsquo;s some magic (written in Go) that generates a large file containing relevant information about all the stops and lines in Muniverse which isn&rsquo;t included in the repository. I think this serves the interests of all parties, providing a great mass of code for those who want to learn Objective-C while keeping blatant plagiarism at bay.</p>

<p>Lest you think this project was entirely for the good will of SFers and Obj-C newbies, let me be clear: this is an obvious ploy to bring in more work. Jamison works on UI/UX stuff as <a href="http://fattrash.com">Fat Trash Design</a> and he&rsquo;s highly recommended if you need this kind of work done. I run a small iOS development shop called <a href="http://launchapps.net">Launch Apps</a> (yay placeholder website!) doing contract work for big and small companies alike. Feel free to get in touch if you like Muniverse and want to see the same level of quality in your own mobile apps.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ssc1GsqHds">youtube video from NASA</a> shows a galactic simulation for approximately 13.5 Billion years. While watching galaxies tear each other apart is fun and all, the fascinating part is that it is, after all, a simulation.</p>

<p>Take some physical rules and enough processing power and you can simulate 13.5 Billion years of dust coming together which in turn attracts more dust and creates stars which attracts more dust which creates young stars which… you get the idea.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wanna back something novel on Kickstarter? <a href="http://www.hyperv.com/">HyperV</a> is attempting to raise funds to develop <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2027072188/plasma-jet-electric-thrusters-for-spacecraft">plasma jet thrusters</a> that could be used in spacecraft outside of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly citizen science (which I&rsquo;d like to see on Kickstarter some day) but it&rsquo;s a great start if you want to be involved with funding an awesome science and technology project and get interesting updates along the way.</p>

<p>Ignore their standard science company website and the slightly awkward funding video and back their awesome project today!</p>

<p>Update: They were successful! They&rsquo;ve done a really great job of keeping backers up-to-date on the project so far, I think this is a great model for science on Kickstarter.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to know that there are actors inside some of the raptors in Jurassic Park. It&rsquo;s quite another thing to see the process of creating the suits and characters themselves.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAzQr3Ml0UI#!">This video</a> and <a href="https://www.stanwinstonschool.com/blog/jurassic-park-evolution-of-a-raptor-suit">post</a> from Stan Winston school of character arts (who knew!) show the whole behind-the-scenes process for creating the raptor. It&rsquo;s incredibly fascinating to watch the movements of the actor go from unfamiliar and jerky to something entirely convincing near the end. He can even play tug of war while being stuffed into the bottom of that suit!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/business-registration-scam/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-06T14:11:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nickoneill.name/business-registration-scam</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the downsides to officially registering with the state as a business is that your address is added to yet another public list and various types of spam increase, regardless of your business&#8217; purpose. Not a huge deal &ndash; this is what the recycling pile is for, right?</p>

<p>I recently received a letter that is actually a problem. It purports to be from an &ldquo;Annual Business Registration&rdquo; office and suggests that you need to pay some amount of money ($218, in my case) and then there&rsquo;s some fear-inducing talk about suspension of your business if you don&rsquo;t file your Statement of Information.</p>

<p>Part of this is true! A Statement of Information does have to be filed with the state in a timely manner and you can be fined for not filing. However, this form is <em>not</em> a statement of information, it&rsquo;s a scam.</p>

<p>The letterhead looks vaguely state-like with a modified California seal (without the term &ldquo;The Great Seal…&rdquo; since it very clearly isn&rsquo;t the actual seal). It includes your business name and LLC number, plus the amount of money you &ldquo;need&rdquo; to pay and a P.O. Box to send your payment to. For reference, here&rsquo;s the address:</p>

<blockquote><p>Annual Business Registration<br/>
P.O. Box 931597<br/>
Los Angeles, CA 90093</p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever you do, do not send your money here. There is no state business registration office in Los Angeles and you will not be penalized for disregarding this piece of junk mail.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/annual-review-board-los-angeles?sort_by=date_desc">Yelp</a>, this exact scam without any modification has been occurring since at least 2009. Is there nothing illegal about deceptively suggesting that the owner here is associated with the state?</p>

    <link href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/beer-recipes-white-house/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-04T13:30:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nickoneill.name/beer-recipes-white-house</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been brewing beer at home since the spring so it was pretty cool to see the White House staff getting into brewing and then releasing their own <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/09/01/ale-chief-white-house-beer-recipe">recipes for Honey Ale and Honey Porter</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to pick up the ingredients for the porter and try it out &ndash; I&rsquo;m sure the <a href="http://www.sanfranciscobrewcraft.com/">Brewcraft store in SF</a> (where I get all my recipes) is getting plenty of requests for those ingredients. So far I&rsquo;ve made a Pale Ale (decent!), an Amber Ale (slightly watery), a Pilsner (tasty but slightly overcarbonated) and an IPA is almost ready to be bottled.</p>

<p>Echoing Sam Kass (White House assistant chef), it&rsquo;s surprisingly easy to make a really tasty beer at home. I would suggest two things if you&rsquo;re new to brewing: get the supplies to do primary and secondary fermentation and pay attention to your sanitization. Transfering to a second container after a few days will get your beer off the dead yeast which can give off weird flavors (there are simple brewing methods that use a single container for all fermentation before the bottle). Keeping equipment sanitized through the entire process is not hard but you have to pay attention to what tools are in a clean state and only use those on your clean equipment (or resanitize them). Wild yeasts and bacteria are everywhere and a batch of fermenting beer can be a pretty ideal place for unpleasant things to grow.</p>

<p>Go forth and brew White House beer!</p>
