<p>The cast list is out for 2013s -biggest disappointment- best movie, the film interpretation of Ender&apos;s Game. And get this: <em>Harrison Ford</em> as <em>Graff</em>.</p>

<p>Otherwise mostly unknowns since it features a bunch of kids. That kid from <em>Hugo</em> as Ender is spot on, otherwise no one is really as I pictured them. Or I simply never had a very good idea of what anyone looked like.</p>

<p>Also, the headshots that kids do for acting are fucking creepy.</p>
