	<h2 class="title">Holidays Book Fest</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>As promised in <a href="http://blog.nickoneill.name/return-of-blog-holidays-edition.html">my last post</a>, some books I&rsquo;ve made my way through (or not) this year:</p>

<p>I started with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">World War Z</a>, the quintessential worldwide zombie outbreak book. The book is told as a series of interviews with survivors around the world, discussing the war from an interesting combination of personal and professional points of view. I enjoyed the format but I doubt it&rsquo;ll survive to the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816711/">movie interpretation</a>. Highly suggested to read before the movie comes out next year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to get through later books in the Ender&rsquo;s Game series a few times after I binge-read a bunch of them a few years ago and this year was no exception with an attempt to get through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ANUQ0K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">Ender in Exile</a>. And again, I couldn&rsquo;t push myself through the religious nonsense and sophomoric whining that the series has come to display in every iteration. At any rate, the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1731141/">Ender&rsquo;s Game movie</a> is finally being made and although I have no idea how much plot they&rsquo;ll fit into the the movie, I do have some hope since an <a href="http://img2.timeinc.net//ew/i/2012/12/03/fl-enders-game_810x543.jpg">early photo</a> looked pretty good.</p>

<p>I picked through a few technical books as well. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0086I5MCO/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">Getting Started with Dwarf Fortress</a> was a huge help getting started. I spent some time in Amsterdam with Steffen Itterheim&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006CO7ZQ0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">Learn cocos2d Game Development</a> though the project I was learning it for didn&rsquo;t pan out.</p>

<p>One of the more fascinating technical books this year was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RI8ZSW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">The New Science of Strong Materials</a> which isn&rsquo;t exactly new but has a number of great atomic-level explainations for material properties.</p>

<p>I have not touched any of the books from the <a href="http://blog.humblebundle.com/post/33237485887/introducing-the-humble-ebook-bundle">Humble ebook Bundle</a> which is unfortunate. Maybe next year.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008TRU7SQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">Richard Rhodes&#8217; <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em></a> is an incredible view into the life of scientists during the lead up to the second world war. In no way is it only about the literal manufacturing of atomic bombs but rather a look at how the chemistry and physics community discussed and developed new results in the first half of the 20th century. I&rsquo;m barely through a third of the book since I picked it up in November because of frequent side trips to Wikipedia to look up technical details or just to remind myself which scientist did what (keeping track of them all would require a dedicated notepad).</p>

<p>I started Isaacson&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PC0S0K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">Einstein</a> biography before that but I couldn&rsquo;t get into it before my focus was stolen away by something else. I may go back and give it another chance given how much I&rsquo;ve enjoyed The Making of the Atomic Bomb with the knowledge that I&rsquo;ll have to slog through the early years before more interesting science comes up.</p>

<p>My last great ambition for reading this year was Nate Silver&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007V65R54/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finestru-20">The Signal and the Noise</a> which did not happen at all. Perhaps I should have started it earlier with respect to the election.</p>

<p>Lastly, my reading device switched from my kindle to an iPad mini late this year. I treat most of my reading as research in that I don&rsquo;t restrict myself from wandering the internet in search of more detail on a particular topic that has come up during reading, so the iPad mini is an incredible tool for me. Previously I would read on the kindle but I would always keep an iPad or computer nearby. Now I can just carry one thing around. I won&rsquo;t give a full review because I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve read others already but as a reading device it&rsquo;s highly recommended.</p>
