<p>I haven&rsquo;t read <em><a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job">Design Is a Job</a></em> yet but you should buy it if you have clients, even if you don&rsquo;t specifically do design.</p>

<p>When he can tear himself away from Twitter, Mike Monteiro does some really great work. In terms of work for <em>his</em> clients and when talking about his process on the <a href="http://weblog.muledesign.com/">Mule Design Blog</a>. And that&rsquo;s why I can recommend <em>Design Is a Job</em> without reading it.</p>
